"Monthly CDS Report. Over the last month, the European CDS market has over-performed the North American market. The iTraxx Europe members are in average 12 bps tighter  while the CDX NA members are in average only 6bps tighter. The European Xover members are 35bps tighter while the North American High Yield members are only 18bps tighter. The trading activity is 50% more important in Europe than in the US, with a 6BUSD per day for the iTraxx Europe members and 4BUSD per day for the CDX NA members (bubble colour) while the outstanding notional is 2.3TUSD and 1.7TUSD respectively (bubble size).

"High Trading Activity at the End of 2013. 
The brown area chart tracks the evolution over the past three years of the aggregated daily market activity  (1)  for this set of 400 corporate CDS. The average volume has been circa 10BUSD per day, the activity has been more important in Q3-Q4 2013, circa 20BUSD per day. We explain this increase by an important portfolio compression activity from the major CDS dealers. The activity should drop by the end of December. It has systematically dropped every Christmas and New Year.  
 
 (1) The data are extracted from the CDS contracts central repository, DTCC/TIW. These data are available on a weekly basis. The daily volumes are computed from the weekly volumes on a pro rata basis depending on the number of trading day in the week. As the volumes are only provided on a name by name basis, the same volume is displayed for all the CDS standard maturities. As the data are provided with a three-day delay, a dashed line indicates the last data as uncertain.

"European Banks  2013: UCGIM vs STANLN .  Grapple selection lets the user browse with an original view on the data. While browsing from  iTraxx Europe All Members  to the  Financial  cluster, the chart displays a list of CDS candlesticks. A candlestick displays simultaneously a double view of the performance of an asset over a given period.  The vertical line displays the trading interval, from the widest to the tightest level. The box displays the variation over the period, from the first day to the last day.  A filled boxes indicates a widening over the period while a hollow box indicates a tightening.  
UCGIM (UniCredit Spa) CDS has traded over the period between 417bps and 170bps, while it has tightened from 299bps to 184bps from the start to the last day of the period. It has been highly volatile but it is trading at the end of the period close to its tightest levels.  
STANLN (Standard Chartered PLC) is the weakest CDS on the period. It has widened from 97.5bps to 108bps, in conjunction with the emerging market weakness over the period.

"Heinz (HNZ) – Too Hot for IG. This view gives a representation of the intensity of the trading activity (size of the box) together with a representation of the direction of the spread move (a name in green has tightened over the period and a name in red has widened). Over the last 12 months, the strength of the market is clear from the vivid green of most names. But we can see a couple of outliers:  - IRMSUB (Iron Mountain Inc) is still recovering from the uncertainty regarding its possibility to convert to a REIT;  - HNZ (H.J. Heinz Company) spread was initially multiplied by 4, surging from 50 to 200 in june 2013 (justifying its move out of CDX IG into CDX HY) following its takeover by Berkshire and the associated releveraging of the company. It has tightened since, but it is now definitely playing in a different league.

"
"Verizon (VZ) – What a Jumbo Does. This grapple offers to view simultaneously the risk premium (expressed as a spread) and the volume traded. In September 2013, VZ (Verizon) brought the biggest bond offering the market has ever experienced, issuing $50bln of debt. There was a significant hedging activity around the deal, leading to a surge in volume (peaking at 550m$ per day) and a peak in spread. The generous pricing of the deal for investors made it a tremendous success and the long maturity of some tranches changed the debt profile, taking financing needs off the agenda. The 5y CDS spread came back with a vengeance, and now trades at the tightest level we have seen for years.

"Credit Index, 82BUSD per Day in November. 
 Grapple selection plus  a cluster blast (), displays the Credit Derivatives Indices trading volumes (panel size) and spread variation (colour)(1) over the last month.  The ITXEB20(2), iTraxx Europe Series 20  Index, has  drained the biggest activity with 30BUSD average per day (move the mouse on the panel, the volume is displayed in the tooltip). The   CDXIG21(2),  CDX NA Investment Grade Index, is second with 20BUSD. The other liquid on-the-run indices are the US High Yield (5BUSD), Europe Xover (5BUSD) and Senior Financials (3BUSD). The roll activity is less important with only 3BUSD ITXEB19 and 1BUSD CDXIG20 trading. The off-the-run CDXIG09 is still relatively active with 2.7BUSD.

"The ECB Largesse. This grapple gives a representation of magnitude of the spread move compared with the absolute value of the spread. The size of the bubble depends on the CDS open position on the name and the color of the bubble depends on the average daily activity during the period. 
In 2013, the move on European financials was uniformly tighter. On each name, the magnitude of this move was essentially a function of the absolute spread of the name. Tightening and compression were in play, without much discrimination. Lower interest rates benefited every single issuer, with the exception of STANLN (Standard Chartered) which felt the effect of the FED potential taper because of its exposure to Asia.

"
"PostNL (TNTNA) Delivers Good News. This is the first of our daily comment, a column we will try and fed with news from the credit market and how it can be analysed through the prism of DataGrapple. 
Thursday December 5th was a day where the pace was set by central banks’ decisions (or absence of…) and comments. The tone was generally softer as evidenced by the different shades of red that dominate this grapple. One notable exception was TNTNA (PostNL NV) which announced its plan to sell roughly half its stake in TNT Express (TNT Express NV)through a private placement and stated its intention to use the 500M€ proceeds to reduce debt. The recent inclusion of PostNL in the CrossOver might prove very temporary.

"
"The Compression Trend. One of the recent themes in the market has been the hunt for yields. This is obvious on this grapple which shows the outperformance of the CrossOver (European sub investment grade universe) and Financial Subordinated indices compared with the European Main index (investment grade universe). Both tightened almost 20bps in November, while Main was stable. One can also see the breadth of this trend as the volumes were healthy, as shown by the intensity of the colours. In that respect, don’t be fooled by the fact that daily CrossOver volume was 6bln€ compared with 39bln€ for Main: their respective spreads now stand at 330bps and 80bps and people tend to structure carry neutral strategies.
"
"J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) Saga. 
 JCP (J.C. Penney Co.) spread is again today wider by 100bps on SEC Inquiry into it Finances.  
This credit story is one of the few ongoing weak credit story development in the US. The CDS activity is soaring with around 150MUSD per day since September,
 around 5% of the 2.6BUSD outstanding bond issuance. The company fate depends on the next shopping season, the market is sceptical.  

"
"The Return of Leverage. In an environment which has been supportive for credit over the last 12 months, a few names have been trading wider, especially in the Consumer Non-Cyclical sector. Releveraging seems to be on the agenda of a few companies through different channels. For instance, on the one hand, DGX ( Quest Diagnostics Inc) experienced weak trading conditions and decided to support its share price through share buy-backs. On the other hand, Campbell Soup (Campbell Soup Company) has been the subject of takeover speculations. Out of the money options on the stock experienced unusually high volumes recently and 5 year protection has been pushed aggressively wider. LBO could be back in people’s mind if they think systemic risks are receding.
"
"The March Steeper. The different series of Main index in Europe are relatively homogeneous in terms of composition. Some names have gone out and others came in, but not to the extent of introducing disproportionate distortion. It is therefore possible to use the population of 10y indices to get a feel of what happened on the shape of the curve. S20 10 is a proxy for actual 10y; S19 10y is a proxy for actual 9.5y; … ; S10 10y is a proxy for the actual 5y. From this view, we see that curves are now linear between 1 and 5 year maturities (series 3 to 10) and that curves are steeper than they were 6 months ago. Given the absolute level of the spreads, the trend steeper is probably over on the short end of the curve though, and we should expect some bull flattening going forward on the 1 to 5 year section.

"
"Assured Gty (AGO) - Puerto Rican blues. After a good run like the rest of the market since the beginning of November, AGO ( Assured Guaranty Ltd.) gave back most its gains over the last week or so despite a generally stable market. FED taper is definitely not helping financials, but worries regarding Assured Guaranty's exposure to Detroit and above all to Puerto Rico have resurfaced recently and taken their toll.
"
"The Roll Is Upon Us. All the ingredients were there today for the single name CDS to experience a bit of widening. The close of the US markets were weak and gave some early momentum to the different credit indices, and bearish equity markets kept that impetus throughout the day. But we are now close to a very technical period for single name CDS, the quarterly roll. Every time we approach this date, investors become much more reluctant to buy protection: the current 5 year CDS will soon no longer be the “on-the-run”, and will no longer be the most liquid maturity. Market participants even take advantage of every move wider in spreads to take some of their short risk positions off, and sell (part of) the 5 year CDS positions they own. They will reload protection once the “new” 5 year will be actively trade, ie on the 20th December. 
That is probably the main reason behind the stability of almost every single name today despite the move wider in credit indices. Today, most of the moves in indices were down to the change in the index bases, the difference between their fair value and their traded level.
"
"The Cost of Litigation. Today the past came back to haunt APC ( Anadarko Petroleum Corporation). A judge ruled that APC and its unit Kerr-McGee acted improperly in the 2005 spinoff of Tronox – which was burdened with environmental debts and eventually went bankrupt in 2009 – and may have to pay between 5 and $15 billion in order to contribute to environmental cleanup and health claims. APC, one of the most actively traded names in the energy sector with an open position of $18.5bln and an average daily volume of $35m since the beginning of November, widened by 16bps today and stands out as the only US name in the energy sector to be wider over the last month.
"
"Into the FOMC at Full Speed. For once the market will wait a little longer than usual before enjoying its Christmas break. This week is packed with events, particularly for CDS. It will begin with the credit index option expiry on Wednesday, shortly followed by the FOMC meeting and the much anticipated decision of the FED regarding tapering. It will eventually conclude on Friday with the roll and the launch of the new 5 year maturity, which will be March 19 during the next 3 months. By the shape of this grapple, taper is not really playing on people’s mind as we are going into the decisive FED’s meeting at the tightest levels of the year. Every index has enjoyed a good ride in 2013, with iTraxx Main tightening 32bps (that is more than 1.5% excess return) and CrossOver 180bps (that is more than 8% excess return). And that does not even factor in the carry earned by all the investors who own risk…
"
"Early Christmas at Dixons. The day before the much awaited final FOMC meeting of 2013, no one was expecting a bold move from the market as a whole. This grapple shows that the tone was somewhat positive, but there was a lot of noise and credits did not move in unison. It took a reassuring set of results from Dixons to make it stand out from the crowd, and the announced deleveraging of the company took the 5 year CDS tighter by more than 20bps (roughly 1% of excess return). Risk premium has not been this low for the name since early 2008.
"
"Trading Until the End. Thanks to tonight’s FOMC, volumes have remained healthy in December so far. Investors have been busy squaring risks off, and roughly $75bln of index were traded everyday on iTraxx and CDX. One of the themes over the last couple of days (but more generally since the summer) has been the outperformance of Europe versus the US, as spreads in the US seem to have reached a floor at 70bps. That was obvious today again, with the investment grade universe tighter by 1.5bps in Europe at 76.5bps while it was 0.25bps wider in the US at 69.875bps. 
"
"When Momentum Builds. A few days ago, we mentioned FSA ( Assured Guaranty Ltd.) and their problems related to Puerto Rico and to the municipalities’ bankruptcies in the US. These concerns have also affected MBIA and have been confirmed in investors’ mind. On the back of that, we have seen a strong momentum build on the risk premium of FSA which have now risen from 377bps to 547bps during the month of December in healthy volumes ($131M were traded last week). When momentum builds in credit, spreads can go a very way…
"
"A Picture of What a Roll Does. As every 20th of December, today was roll day for single name CDS (not for the indices which roll every 6 months in March and September). When dealers quote 5y, they now quote Mar 19 maturity as opposed to Dec 18 up to yesterday. This can be seen by the daily variations which are based on the 5 year “on-the-run” and do not take into account the change in effective maturity. The vast majority of the names are reddish, as one would expect them to be: with generally steep curves, the longer dated the CDS, the wider. But while we should expect a widening of roughly: (3y5y slope + 5y7y slope)/16, single names have far less widened across the board. We have experienced a “bull roll”, where dealers have not factored in the full roll-up along the curve. Hence the theoretical value of Main Europe 5y (whose maturity is still Dec18) has tightened by 2bps today. That is a very healthy move considering its absolute level is now only 69bps!
"
"Merry Christmas!. That is the closest Grapple to a Christmas tree we could get! It shows that 2013 was very supportive for credit, especially if you had carry to the reduction in risk premia across the board. A few bright red spots also show that when you invest in credit you have to be very selective, as some names have defaulted and others have widened viciously. Generally speaking, Santa will be knocking on most credit investors’ door! The teams of Hellebore Capital Management and Cleared Derivatives Solutions both wish you all a very merry Christmas!
"
"Happy New Year!.  First and foremost, the teams of Hellebore Capital Management and DataGrapple both wish you all a Happy New Year! 
The credit market entered 2014 as it finished 2013: the first few sessions have been constructive and the reduction of risk premia has been broad based - with the notable exception of HTZ ( Hertz Global Holdings Inc.) following the news of a stake in the company built by activist investor Carl Icahn -. Investors have allegedly cash to invest and corporates can issue at historically low yields. Hence plenty of new issues are expected over the next few weeks. We will see if it triggers some hedging activity in the CDS market…

"
"The Hunt For Yield… Already!. 2014 is barely a week old and the hunt for yield is already at full steam. Names from the periphery have been the main beneficiaries of the first few sessions of the year. Today was no different and these corporates took full advantage of it, through a raft of new issues. A number of deals were brought to the market today, and none was less than twice oversubscribed (and multiple of that in many cases). ELEPOR ( EDP – Energias de Portugal SA) came with a $500m 7 year deal with a guidance of T+325/337.5 which eventually became a $750m 7 year deal priced at T+300. Under these circumstances, even though the end of 2013 was extremely busy in terms of bond issuance, it is difficult to imagine anything else than more new issue in the days to come.
"
"CIR S.P.A. (CIR) – Orphaning fears. In a filing made a few days ago, CIRIM (Compagnie Industriali Riunite) announced that they could redeem the outstanding bonds maturing in 2024 which they issued back in 2004. It currently represents the bulk of the company’s traded debt, and if it is called there will be almost no deliverable left for credit default swap contracts. So when the news hit the tape, bids for protection were pulled aggressively and the 5y tightened accordingly. The 5y CDS spread gapped again yesterday when this information was given more air time by a dealer. This shows one of the issues you might face if you buy protection. 
It is only one of the credit positive news that recently emerged (together with some IPO announcements and some decent results in December) and triggered some short risk covering in the Xover space. That explains the stubbornly positive basis we have seen in the Xover index.

"
"Doubts Over The New CDS Definition?. Today was the first day of consolidation since the beginning of the year, as the market wanted to take a breather ahead of the tomorrow’s NFP. 
Nevertheless, this grapple describes well the trends since the beginning of the year. The outperformance of the peripheral is clear from the tightening of the SovX index which overweights periphal countries. The outperformance of Xover compared with Main shows the hunt for yield which led to some compression. 
The underperformance of the Sub Financial index compared with the Senior Financial index reflects the recent doubts expressed by some investors regarding the timing of the implementation of the new CDS documentation which will incorporate a “bail in” credit event. Future CDS on financial entities will offer much better protection, and people had anticipated a switch out of existing CDS into new ones once they are available, especially in the subordinated space. Some sold sub protection on the back of it. The March 2014 implementation is now questioned and could be delayed, hence the widening of the Sub index.

"
"The basis : A new available Grapple !. We are pleased to introduce a new type of Grapple : the basis between the market quoted price of indices and their theoretical value (derived from the prices of their constituents). The basis is expressed in cents (it is the difference of the index fair value cash price and the index quoted cash price), so that it is homogenous between indices and tenors. The basis of the CDX IG9 10Y illustrates how volatile this parameter can be: on the back on systemic risks (right after the default of Lehman at the end of 2008, the discount between theoretical and quoted price was  almost 6%); on the back of market technicals (during the seconf half of 2012 when the much talked about “London Whale” was roaming the market, the discount was consistently between 1 and 2%); or even in the quieter market conditions which prevailed in 2013, the basis has been alternatively positive and negative in fairly quick succession.
"
"New Year indigestion?. In the financial space, the big news over the week-end was the release of a new draft of the Net Stable Funding Ratio by the Basel Committee as well as announcing an easing of leverage ratio requirements. The stocks of all financial institutions benefitted from this piece of news and was up on the day. But it was a completely different story in credit where all European financial CDS were indicated wider. The intense activity in the primary market since the beginning of the year made investors take a breather. The unexpected Non Farm Payroll miss on Friday might also have played a part, as it somewhat blurred the global economic picture.
"
"When Indices Move Faster Than Single CDS.  Protection for Credit Indices begun the day very well bid on the back of a weak US close and a weak Asian session. For instance, the iTraxx Main (ITXEB20) traded 2bps wider (or nearly 10 cents in cash price) right out of the gate. The broader market of single name CDS swiftly followed, and credit moved wider in unison. But during the afternoon, while there was still a nagging bid for single name protection, some hedges put on last week on indices came out and indices outperformed their theoretical value across the board.
"
"Back to Business!. Since the beginning of the year, the market has been busy trading credit derivatives. Risk premia are at historically tight levels and credit indices are trading at prices not seen since early 2008, both in Europe and in the US. That has triggered an active hedging campaign from investors who have been busy buying protection on credit indices, directly or through options. On the back of that, daily volumes stand well above what we have seen in previous years ($91.5bln on average each day of last week compared with $71bln at the same period last year, $84bln at the beginning of 2012 and $56.5bln in January 2011). Volumes were also very healthy on single names (almost $13bln per day), on the back of tight spread levels and an intense new issue pipeline. 2014 is now well underway!
"
"Short End Bull Flattening. Every six months, a new series of indices is issued so that they comply with maturity and composition constraints. As all indices are dated, it is possible to use older series of indices to assess the risk premium which the market affects to non-standard maturities. For instance, iTraxx Main S20 10y has a Dec23 maturity; iTraxx S19 10y has a Jun22 maturity;…; iTraxx Main S10 10y has a Dec18 maturity;… 
If we put aside the composition discrepancies, it is therefore possible to use old series of iTraxx Main 10 year as a good indication of where the different points of the European investment grade universe are trading, or at least at the way they have moved compared each other over a short period of time. This grapple illustrates a phenomenon typically seen in a spread tightening environment. Because shorter dated spreads are tighter than longer dated ones, they have less room to tighten. Their move in percentage terms can be as large, but in absolute terms their move will be less important, leading to a short end flattening of the spread curves. It gives this grapple its lovely smile!

"
"Staples (SPLS) – Momentum Is Building. Since the beginning of the year, the feedback from trading during the holiday season has not been great among most US retailers. Best Buy (Best Buy Co., Inc.) shares had a torrid day yesterday plunging almost 30% after delivering uninspiring sales figures. The heat was also felt by SPLS (Staples, Inc.) whose stock fell roughly 4%. But the most impressive trend recently is the pace at which its CDS is currently widening. Since the 7th January 2014, the risk premium of SPLS has increased every single day, and its 5y CDS have traded all the way up from 153bps to 208bps at the close tonight. It looks as if some momentum is seriously building…
"
"Hard Time For US Retailers...All of Them. SPLS (Staples, Inc.) has already been mentioned in a previous comment regarding the hard time it is getting from the credit market since early January. It is actually a fate that all US retailers (to various degrees though) have been sharing. Even though risk premia have generally decreased over the last 5 weeks (CDX Investment Grade in the US is tighter by 5bps during this period), all US retailers are wider. It is therefore not surprising to see that they are all part of the same statistical cluster (North America / Retail) at the moment. They have all moved in unison and have trended against the market since mid-December. 
"
"The Tight Range. Since the beginning of the year, the risk premia of some single name issuers have been volatile. For instance today, the 5y CDS of ALOFP (Alstom SA) was wider by 14bps to 160bps following a profit warning and a lack of visibility on guidance. But from a more macro perspective, the market have been very well behaved. The trading range of all indices has been extremely narrow (15bps for iTraxx Xover and 3.5bps for iTraxx Main over the last month). Some investors have begun to play the range and implied volatility are trading at historically low levels. Combined with the tight level of spreads, buying downside protection through options is looking more and more appealing.
"
"Releveraging is flavour of the day. The hunt for yield has led investors to look implicitly for leverage. They cannot buy enough of any hybrid or Coco brought in abundance to the market by their favourite investment banker… And corporates are also doing their bit in increasing the leverage of the market. Some are buying back their stocks, others borrow to pay dividends. And if they do not do it fast enough, they fall prey to activist investors. For instance, Third Point took a significant stake in DOW (The Dow Chemical Company), calling for a split of the company. That put a dent in the usually well behaved curve of its 5y CDS spread. 
"
"A Day of Pure Beta…. Today marked the first session of the year where questions have been asked regarding the recent asset prices trajectory. Credit was not spared and credit indices experienced their worst performance so far in 2014 by a fair margin. When this kind of move takes place, indices are usually leading the way, and they react faster than single names, the latter playing catch up during the following sessions (or indices going all the way back!). Today was different. There was hardly any outliers. The credit spread of almost every single name was indicated wider, and the fair value of indices have tracked almost suspiciously the quoted indices. At the end the day, a 15ct move in iTraxx Main only triggered a move of 1ct in the basis with its fair value. After the heavy new issue pipeline we have seen so far this year and a few disappointing sets of results, some names were due for a correction and market participants were probably happy to mark them wider without necessarily much trading going through. We now have new found levels that should give a platform for trading to happen. Expect more action on the basis during the next significant move (whichever way the market takes us).

"
"It Took only Two Days. If the market has been complacent since early December, that phase is now officially over. Serious questions have been asked about risk premia over the last couple of sessions, as cracks began to open in emerging markets. Flagship credit indices, the iTraxx Main and the CDX IG, are trading at levels last seen in early November 2013, even though investors have earned carry on their investments. Research pieces sent at the end of 2013, which became obsolete in 3 weeks as targets were already reached, will be worth revisiting. We shall see whether the next risk ramp-up will be as indiscriminate as what we have seen recently or if investors will be more selective this time around. This ramp-up phase might not happen immediately though, as the market still does not look very healthy. In any case, people will want to know what central banks decide next week, in the US and in Europe.
"
"Indices Are The Preferred Hedge…. Over the last few sessions, the market has experienced some wild swings. Today for instance, the total variation of iTraxx Main 5y was more than 20bps, even though close to close the widening was limited to 2bps close to close. The velocity was such that single names struggled to keep pace with the indices, and most of them missed the last leg wider of the day. That led to a sharp increase in the basis between most indices and their theoretical value. It is now worth almost 1% of the cash price of the iTraxx Xover index and more than 25cts of the cash price of the iTraxx Main index. Even with a hampered liquidity in single name market given the recent volatility, we are definitely in arbitrage territory.
"
"How Statistical Clusters Work?.  The weekly variation of the CDS market since the beginning of the market correction last week  has been nervous but orderly on the European high beta CDS.  The statistical clusters are aggregating the single names by class of risks. This week, these clusters have widened in proportion of their average level. All the bubbles except one are perfectly aligned. The non-investment grade communications sector has outperformed the marked. This is due to a single name outperformance. The CDS   of the Spanish cable company Ono tighter by 50 bps on Vodafone offer to buy the company. 

"
"Combining Volumes and Volatility. Today’s close to close move is hardly a fair reflection of the volatility the market experienced. Credit has visited both ends of its new found trading range. For instance, Itraxx Main opened at 77bps, traded all the way up to 85bps, before settling at 81.75bps. Credit recently proved much more volatile than most other asset classes - except the Turkish Lira of course - . Interestingly, this volatility took place with heavy volumes going through, especially over the last week or so. The intense activity of Thursday and Friday last week was enough to bring last week’s volumes 25% above what they were a year ago on credit indices, and 50% higher on single names. That trend only amplified since Monday with more investors putting hedges on or off. If you are looking for a volatile asset class where you can implement your views in decent size, look no further than the CDS market.
"
"The new weak spot, the European HY?.   The European Xover names failed to rally today while the European investment grade names are closing unchanged. The US credit complex was stronger that the whole European credit complex. Since the start of the market correction, the relationship between the European credit and the US credit was rather strong. However, the market is wondering if the strong outperformance of the European Credit is out of breath and if the European Credit is eventually at risk with the tapering (If you click on the 1Y interval after reading this comment you can observe the outperformance of the European Credit over the past year). With the domino effect, we should keep a close eye on the European High Yield credit in the following days. 
"
"Hellenic Telecom (OTE) – The M&A Risk. Following last year mid-summer’s wobbles, OTE (Hellenic Telecommunications Organization S.A.) had a great run until mid-January 2014. Its 5 year risk premium shrunk from 800bps to less than 300bps (i.e. almost 18% in cash price). Then, a couple of weeks ago, it was caught in the Emerging Markets related weakness (the proximity of Greece and Turkey did certainly not help). But this week, Deutsche Telekom CEO had a meeting with Antonis Samaras – the Greek Prime Minister – and the management of OTE. That was enough to stir articles in the Greek press that DT (Deutsche Telekom AG), in order to boost its current stake, might buy the 10% of OTE still owned by the Greek state. If the 5 year CDS of DT did not bulge, the 5 year risk premium of OTE was indicated 80bps tighter (i.e. almost 4% in cash price) when the rumour emerged, and eventually settled 40bps tighter. 
Following up yesterday’s comment, it is interesting to note that despite the outperformance of OTE, the iTraxx Xover index (which includes OTE) meaningfully underperformed the iTraxx Main index, confirming the decompression theme that emerged over the last few sessions.
"
"The Great Decompression. Given the magnitude of the move in equities today, credit was relatively well behaved. iTraxx Main traded in a 3bps range, which is nothing compared with the roller coaster sessions we experienced last week. That left (again) decompression as the main feature of the day, with Xover underperforming Main, but it was most obvious between the Itraxx Financial Senior (ITXES) and iTraxx Financial Subordinated (ITXEU) indices. The latter move was triggered by the ISDA’s decision not to implement the change in the CDS definition initially scheduled for next March before September 2014. That means in particular that contracts giving more rights to buyers of protection on subordinated debt will not be available for another 8 months. Investors, who had been reluctant to buy protection which would have turned second best in 6 week time, were not willing to wait another 2 quarters before hedging their portfolios and pulled the trigger.
"
"What have they done today?. A new grapple is available since yesterday. It ranks products according to their performance during the selected time frame. If you selected a crowded population, a few labels could go missing but if you position your mouse on the chart, the name of your product shows up together with details of its performance. A blue candle means the risk premium has increased and a white candle means it has decreased. So today, you were better invested in peripheral names and in financials and accordingly most of them can be found on the right hand side of this grapple. 
Please also note that a “Year To Date” time frame is also now available. It sits comfortably between the 6M and 1Y options.
"
"J.C.Penney (JCP) – Default Concerns.  On February 4th, JCP (J.C. Penney Company, Inc. Ltd) published numbers regarding the months of November and December. They are highlighting the difficulties the company is facing in its turnaround and led investors to believe they could continue to sell more but at lower than expected gross margins. Hence a liquidity raise could be in the cards which unsurprisingly pushed the 5 year risk premium higher. But the figures released also seriously increased the prospects of a possible default and 1 year protection jumped to 16 points upfront  (it now costs 16% upfront plus an additional 5% running to insure against a default of JCP until March 2015) up from 12 points a few days ago. Selling short dated protection definitely requires a solid credit check.
"
"Volatility Translates Into Volume. If you ask any market participants what has been the most salient feature of the credit market over the last couple of weeks, the unanimous answer will “extreme volatility”. But except for a significant daily variation on the 24th January, it is not obvious from looking at the graph representing the close to close. Most of the volatility took place intraday, especially on indices, as every move was exacerbated by option players who had to manage chunky negative gamma positions. The best estimator of that intense volatility is actually the volumes that have been traded during this period. And they have been impressive recently. Combining Europe and the US, during the last week of January, $167bln of indices traded each day on average. If we except the weeks around the rolls, there was a fortnight in July last year (anyone remembers the effect of QE taper?) when volumes were higher. 
"
"Air France (AFFP)-Equity Gives You Wings. In a day where almost all the risk premia have gone down, it was still possible to spot a few stand out performers in the credit market. After SAS (SAS AB) announced it was stepping up its refinancing efforts with a planned issue of preferred shares and convertible bonds for a total consideration of SEK4Bln, investors suspected that AFFP (Air France - KLM) could also follow the equity raising route. That led to the its stock going down (-3.6%) and its 5 year CDS spread tightening by 30bps. The other credit outperformer was found in the TMT space: ONOFII (ONO) has reached an agreement with Vodafone for Vodafone to buy them. ONO’s 5 year CDS tightened by a further 40bps to 100bps, after an already stellar performance since the beginning of the year, as this news is only a confirmation of a deal which has been rumoured for a while.
"
"Centrica (CENTRI) – Too Good a Business?. In a market which was globally well supported, it was a bit surprising to see CENTRI (Centrica Plc), a traditionally well behaved issuer, among the underperformers. It suffered from a letter sent by the UK’s energy secretary to regulators asking them to investigate whether the company is not too profitable. The idea of a breakup of their British Gas unit was floated, and that led to a fall in the share price (-1.5% at the close but -4% at some stage during the day) and a firm bid to the 5 year protection (+4.5bps at 74.5bps at the close). Despite the claim that Britain is one of the most competitive energy market made by British Gas management, it seems that, across the board, political risks from government action could be rising for utilities.
"
"What Difference a Week Makes. Over the last week, it seems that most of the concerns the market had have gone away. Risky assets have been moving in a straight line, and the picture given by the credit universe heat map is quite telling. With the exception of AMKR (Amkor Technology, Inc) which suffered from the tough environment affecting Tech companies and guided very cautiously for the quarters ahead when they published their results on Monday, the colour is bright green. The high beta names were the outperformers, and it seems that EM are no longer a threat to the global economy. Mrs Yellen appears to have struck all the right notes in her first speech as Fed chairman, and investors want to have faith in her action. They appear to firmly believe that last week NFP were just a bump on the road to recovery.
"
"Morrisson (MRWLN) – Up For Sale?. A month ago, there was a first alert on MRWLN (Wm. Morrisson Supermarkets Plc) when Elliott Associates built a stake in the company. Rumours that a leveraging of the company via a spin-off of their property assets was in the cards were flying around back then. The 5 year CDS never recovered completely and it only participate reluctantly in the recent rally. Today, it took a second leg wider when it was said that the founding family had approached private equity funds such as CVC Capital and Carlyle. Analysts are divided on the feasibility of what would be a $13bln deal, but the market decided it was better safe than sorry and the name was marked 20bps wider (i.e. 1% in cash price) on the day.
"
"Corporate Activity and CDS Premium. In the world of equities, when a company is the subject of corporate activity and is a takeover target, the only way is up. It is a different story in credit. Yesterday we have seen that MRWLN (Wm. Morrisson Supermarkets Plc) ’s risk premium increased significantly after investors speculated the company could interest private equity group and could be leveraged. Today TWC (Time Warner Cable Inc) was taken over by Comcast in an all stock $45bln deal, and TWC’s risk premium came crashing down (its 5 year CDS traded down from 182bps to 75bps), as it was brought in line with Comcast’s. Equity and credit do not necessarily move in perfect harmony.
"
"Lost For Direction. Over the last few sessions, a lot of investors have been left scratching their head regarding what could happen next to the market. Even though assets have been performing well during the last week, most people are still concerned about emerging markets and are wondering what the real direction of the American economy is after a raft of disappointing statistics. This has translated into tighter trading ranges on the credit indices, somewhat lower volumes, and also a convergence of bases (difference between the quoted price of an index and the fair value derived from its constituents) towards 0. When things are moving slower, market inefficiencies are less obvious.
"
"The Gamma Pins. With the US closed for President’s day, today was never expected to be a standout session. Indeed, all indices traded within a very tight range, most of them actually hardly moving at all. In fact, one should not hold his breath expecting much more volatility over the next two sessions either. In the credit space, clients have been selling February volatility on options, with 75 on iTraxx Main and 275 on iTraxx Xover being 2 of the most popular strikes. It has created a big gamma positive position among the dealer community around the current levels. Barring any extraordinary event, these 2 gamma pins should be enough to keep European indices within their recent tight range until the February option expiry date, which falls on Wednesday 19th.
"
"Cable Is Where the Action Is. The communication sector in the US has moved broadly in line with the rest of the market over the last week, tightening gently along the way. There are 2 noticeable exceptions though, as M&A; is raging in the cable industry. TWC (Time Warner Cable Inc) has fallen for CMCSA (Comcast Corporation) in an all-stock deal after having been courted by Charter Communications. The spectrum of leverage going away has enabled TWC’s risk premium to tighten significantly and to be more than halved since last Wednesday. But Charter Communications may not lick its wounds for long before trying to grab another piece of the consolidating cable industry. COXENT (Cox Communications, Inc) may be an attractive consolation price for Mr Malone. On the back of these speculations, COXENT’s risk premium has increased by 50% in 5 trading sessions.
"
"What Will £5bln Buy You?. According to the market, £5bln will clearly help you buy a UK retailer. There were renewed speculations around MRWLN (Wm. Morrisson Supermarkets Plc) as a group of banks are rumoured to be preparing a £5bln financing package for private equity groups. On the back of these speculations, MRWLN’s risk premium took another leg wider in the afternoon (its 5 year CDS has more than double since the beginning of the year, widening from 70bps to 156.5bps). At the other end of the price action, the Liberty Media sphere was also busy, with Mr Malone allegedly drawing plans for his succession, which would involve assets’ sale. Retailers and Cable have been 2 very popular themes recently. In Europe, it is mainly based on speculation, and it merely shows that the market is a bit short of ideas at the moment.
"
"On The Road To Recovery. Since September 2013 and the announcement of their surprise deal with Microsoft Corporation to which they agreed to sell their mobile-phone division, the risk premium of NOKIA (Nokia Oyj) has been steady. Even though it underperformed slightly the iTraxx CrossOver, it has been well behaved. Today, the company was said to be considering merging its Nokia Solutions and Networks unit with Juniper. The tie-up could be an alternative to a deal with Alcatel-Lucent and would strengthen Nokia’s US business. As further reports eventually surfaced saying the deal was not imminent, NOKIA’s 5 year CDS closed at 190bps, off its tightest level of the day. But still, the market took it as a sign of a step further on the road to recovery.
"
"Two Stand Out Sectors. Since the beginning of the year, most of the sectors have performed in line with the market, and risk premia have moderately risen. Surprisingly enough, even though worries regarding Emerging Markets were the reason behind the big January sell-off, it was difficult to build a successful portfolio based on geographical exposure. The main driver explaining the performance of the 2 stand out sectors was actually M&A;, with 2 radically different outcomes. In the retail space, buyers are suspected to fancy leveraging their targets, and that send risk premium sharply higher. In the cable sector, asset disposals could on the contrary lead to deleveraging, making it the best performer of 2014 so far.
"
"Retail CDS &#x39A&#x3B1&#x3BA&#x3B1&#x3B2&#x3B9&#x3B1. 
The retail space is subject to a lot of activity in the UK and in the US. After, Wm. Morrison Supermarkets Plc (MRWLN) ) buyout rumours, the news flow is again significant today on this sector. The sector is going through an active consolidation and restructuration while earnings are not good.

Carphone Warehouse PLC  is in preliminary talks to merge with DIXONS RETAIL PLC (DXNSLN). This is credit positive for Dixons CDS as it can be orphan or eventually trade into Carphone which has much less leverage.


Cerberus is said to be lead Safeway Inc. (SWY)  bidder. The CDS is 50 bps wider. The news came after the London close Friday and the movement is only reflected today into DataGrapple.


New Albertson’s, Inc (ABS) CDS is 90bps tighter. This is a LBO CDS. Cerberus owns the company and the market is speculating on synergies with SWY, ABS  could trade closer to SWY.


J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP)  CDS is 1.5% upfront wider pre earnings release.  JCP is a member of IG9, an off-the-run index, underlying of many CDO hedges.  The volatility on JCP could be significant. 


Dillard’s, Inc (JCP)   CDS is 25 bps wider post weak earnings. The gross margin is declining on weaker sales.


"
"Credit Compression.   The equity market is up on a year to date basis. It is worth to have a look at the credit performance on a year to date basis. The investment grade names are still slightly wider while the non-investment grade names are tighter. The market is looking for yield and is cautious on leveraging the investment grade. We had a good sequence of credit positive stories in the Xover index and the investment grade is subject to M&A; risk.  But, the Xover names are “over invested” as the only way to easily add risk to portfolios. In case of risk reversal, the Xover could gap much wider and faster than the investment grade names. 
"
"Wednesday Traded Volumes Update.  This morning,  DTCC-TIW has released its latest CDS trading activity weekly reports. Last week, the corporate credit indices have stabilized at 100BUSD per day while the single names CDS at 12BUSD per day. Noticeably, the US consumer sectors are overwhelming. This sectors represent more than half of the index activity while making only 48 of the 125 names. A few names like Safeway Inc. (SWY)  are   outstanding form their historical perspectives. Next week figure shall be even higher as the start of the week has been very active on both the US consumer sectors.
"
"Is this real?.  The Basis trading is chasing the price discrepancy between the trading level of an index and the cost to hedge all its components using the single name CDS.  There is an important activity on the on-the-run indices basis but there are also many opportunities in the off-the-run indices. Looking at the chart of all the basis on the 10Y maturities, we can see a significant dispersion of the basis and the basis last year variation.  The ability to manage a complex portfolio of basis is offering a lot of diversification for those able to source off-the-run indices. If this graph is real, there are a lot of investment opportunities.
"
"Behind the Screen.   Either in Europe investment grade or crossover, US investment grade or non-investment grade, behind the end of month credit indices rally,  there is  a lot of dispersion across the credit spectrum. Looking at Europe investment grade, no sector is tighter since the beginning of the year. The performance is really mixed.  The industrial sector is the weakest as it is considered the most dependent on the emerging markets. The retail sector in Europe is weak but it is mainly due to Wm. Morrison Supermarkets Plc (MRWLN) . Worth to notice, the Financial CDS are rather stable, Standard Chartered PLC (STANLN) being the weakest.  

You just have to click on each bubble using the bubble charts to scroll down into the single CDS dispersion. 


"
"The Ukrainian Impact. Since the beginning of the year, European and US indices have moved in unison and their respective percentage moves have been tracking each other closely. It was a slightly different story today, with the perceived geopolitical risk escalation in Ukraine. Throughout the day, the market was told of Russia’s growing military presence in Crimea. This eventually led to a significant underperformance of European Indices compared with their US equivalent. The spread between the iTraxx Main Europe and the US CDX IG, the two investment grade benchmark indices, is close to 10bps, which close the widest level of the year reached in late January when risk premia were hit by Emerging Market jitters. 
"
"Is The Basis Directional?. Since the beginning of the year, investors’ faith in the underlying strength of the economy has been rock solid. Even during the rocky patches, sellers of bonds have been few and far between as they fear they would have a hard time buying them back. Except in very specific instances, when potential leverage was worrying investors for instance, they have also been reluctant to buy protection on single names as they see few catalyst for weakness to persist. Instead, they have elected the indices as the instruments of choice to hedge the potential volatility of their portfolio. Hence the fair value of the indices have been quite stable and a good part of the moves of indices have been down to the variation of the basis (difference between their quoted spread and their theoretical spread). Over the last couple of months, there was an important correlation between the direction of the moves of indices and their bases. 
"
"RSH - The End of a Model?. RSH (RadioShack Corporation) published its results yesterday. The electronics chain posted fourth quarter sales that trailed analysts’ estimates and announced plan to close more than 1,000 stores. Despite the kudos it got for its ad during the SuperBowl, people are still not convinced why they should shop there. RSH’s risk premium has raised very aggressively over the last 2 sessions, and even short dated protection is now trading at unprecedented level for the name: investors are asking to be paid around 25% to take 1 year risk. Serious questions are being asked about the future of RSH, even the very short one.
"
"Ukraine? Nothing To Worry about. The volumes traded last week were published yesterday by DTCC, and by and large they confirmed what the price action indicated. If the mini Emerging Market crisis we went through in late January spooked investors, the Ukrainian situation is not worrying them. Over the last couple of weeks, even though the situation was clearly deteriorating, risk premia were on the way down and volumes were diminishing as well, both pointing to a contained need (and will) to hedge. We had a very brief spike in risk aversion on Monday, but since the “grind tighter” (that is how credit market participants called a gradual erosion of risk premia) has resumed. Issuers actually made the most of this positive attitude, as a raft of new issues were brought to the market over the last 3 days.
"
"Dispersion. If you look at the daily change in fair value on all indices (iTraxx Main’s has moved +0.07bps, iTraxx Xover’s -1.00bps and CDX IG’s -0.04bps), you would be forgiven for thinking the session was probably a bit dull. But first you would be missing the intraday volatility that the credit market has experienced today (nothing extraordinary, but still 2.5bps from peak to trough). And also you would mainly be missing the significant dispersion between the different names. To only name two, the 5 year risk premium of CERVTECSUB (Cerved Group Spa) was 70bps tighter (ie almost 3.5% in cash price price) after Il Sole indicated this morning that the company is looking to list before the summer and is holding talks to appoint banks, while the 5 year CDS of SWY (Safeway Inc.) traded 35bps wider (ie 1.5% in cash price) after it agreed to be bought by Cerberus Capital Management which intends to merge it with Albertsons (the 5 year CDS of which was 45bps tighter by the way).
"
"Compression Is Relentless. Since the beginning of the year, the compression trend between iTraxx Main (ITXEB), which represents the risk premium of the investment grade universe in Europe, and iTraxx CrossOver (ITXEX), which is the closest to a high yield risk premium indicator we have in Europe, has been relentless. You can actually click on all the different time span between 6 months and 1 day and the picture will be the same. CrossOver has consistently outperformed Main. Many factors contributed to that trend: investors’ desperate search for yield has been a consistent feature throughout 2014, rumours of big cross assets positions being unwound (short CrossOver risk / long equity risk), M&A; operations targeting CrossOver constituents all resulting in orphaning fears or a migration towards investment grade. 
"
"The Roll Is upon Us. Over the last few sessions, the Credit Default Swap market has entered a technical period. On the 20th March, the “on-the-run” contracts will not be the ones maturing in March of each year any longer but rather the contracts maturing in June. These “on-the-run” contracts tend to attract the most liquidity and are the instruments of choice of the credit derivatives market. That is the reason why activity is usually more subdued in the sessions preceding the roll, and risk premia tend to erode on the soon to become “off-the-run” CDS leading to a grind tighter ahead of the roll, when the market is otherwise quiet. That phenomenon is obvious for everyone to see on this grapple. The 3 exceptions are AALLN (Anglo American Plc) and GLEINT (Glencore Xstrata Plc) which have been impacted by the recent commodity sell-off, and BOUY (Bouygues SA) which has been involved in the sale of SFR. 
"
"Exposure to China. The first warning signs regarding emerging markets and China first appeared back in January. Worries around growth in China resurfaced a week ago, when surprisingly weak economic data were released with exports falling 18% while the market was expecting a 7% increase. Investors were quick to associate this weakness with potential decline in appetite for commodities in general and steal products in particular.  All the names in the sector have had a torrid last few sessions. Their risk premia have substantially increased, in meaningful volumes. Not surprisingly, in the European investment grade universe, AALLN (Anglo American Plc) and GLEINT (Glencore Xstrata Plc) stand out as the worst performers over the last week.
"
"Basis: The Credit Speedometer. The price action was very benign for most of the day. But mid-afternoon headlines about military escalation in Ukraine surfaced, and that really brought fear into the market. Credit indices started to move wider fairly fast and as we often see in these circumstances, single names were slower to react and their move was more contained. That led to a sharp move of the basis (difference between an index quoted price and its fair value) which, on iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX), went from 55cts to more than a 1%. The market already experienced such a basis move when the Emerging Market crisis broke in late January. Whenever a violent move takes place in credit, you can tell its velocity by the magnitude of the basis change.
"
"Fundamentals Still Matter. Credit was extremely volatile today and sentiment was very fickle: first investors appeared very wary of the situation in Ukraine and were desperate for hedges pushing indices close to recent wides, and then in the afternoon these fears went away and indices closed tighter on the day. But during this whole madness, one name steadily ground tighter: BOUY (Bouygues SA). When it was known that VIVFP (Vivendi SA) had decided to enter into exclusive talk with ALTICE (Altice SA) regarding the sale of SFR, worries about BOUY piling on debt to acquire the mobile operator alleviated and the 5 year risk premium was able to stay on its recent downward trajectory.
"
"A Day Of Reversal. Today was a complete reversal of the price action we witnessed last week, and the panicky feeling that was obvious at some stage back then was completely gone. Hence the best performers of the day are the names that bore most of the pain over the previous few sessions. Names which are perceived as exposed to emerging markets in general and to commodities in particular experienced the best session, with GLEINT (Glencore Xstrata Plc), AALLN (Anglo American Plc) and HOLZSW (Holcim Ltd) leading the pack.
"
"Looking For New Xover Names. The new series of CDX and iTraxx indices will be issued on Thursday. We will move to series 22 in the US and series 21 in Europe for “on-the-run”. One of the significant changes is the expansion of iTraxx Xover to 60 constituents going forward as opposed to 50 in the previous series. To do so, Markit had to go down in the liquidity spectrum and some names which were hardly trading in CDS (but which have issued at least €500mln indebt over the last 12 months) have been included. They appear for the first time in Datagrapple today, and you can see that the market is still trying to find out what their correct risk premia should be. Most of these names can be found in the top 5 and bottom 5 performers of the day. Volumes going through on those names are not big at the moment, dealers have another couple of days to make up their mind before the action really start on them.
"
"Rien Ne Va Plus…. During a session where most assets have traded sideways, it took some specific pieces of news to move risk premia. Wimpelcom announced its plan to improve WINDIM (Wind Acquisition Finance) capital structure by repaying its PIK and issuing €800m of senior debt from WINDIM. The news of the issue of a bond deliverable into WINDIM CDS sent the 5 year risk premium 50bps wider (2.5% in cash price) and made it one the bright red spots. The other one is LADLN (Ladbrokes Plc) which widened by almost 30bps in the wake of the UK budget announcement, which included an increase in fixed-odds betting terminals’ (or FOBT, aka slot machines) taxation to 25%. Considering the equity plunge (-13.9%), one could argue that the 5 year CDS was well behaved.
"
"The Roll Exposed. Today was roll day in the CDS space. That means that the so called 5 year point which is the most liquid part of the curve has moved out by a quarter from Mar19 to Jun19. The data displayed on DataGrapple follow the same rule, and the 5y risk premium is always the “on the run” risk premium. Considering that the fair value of the iTraxx Main S20 has not changed, one can say that single names have not moved much globally. Hence today’s daily changes give a fairly accurate estimate of the difference between the Mar19 and Jun19 CDS. This Grapple gives you an idea of the extra risk premium you are asked to pay (or that you can expect to receive) to extend the maturity of a position by 3 months. If you look at the Bubble view, you will see that this extra spread is a linear function of the 5 year risk premium and is worth 5% of it, except for the weakest names where hedges have to be put in place.
"
"Crossover Roll: The Unexpected Winners. When the composition of the Crossover is modified, the common belief is that new entrants will suffer as they are now part of the hedging tool most widely used by portfolio managers, and that names existing the index will benefit. This Grapple paints a slightly different picture, and shows that this time around, if the exiting names are among the best performers since the beginning of the week, the new entrants are also part of this elite group. Dealers might have been a bit harsh on them on Monday anticipating high demand for protection, and these high risk premia triggered some clients’ selling of CDS. The hunt for yield is still on, and some of the names joining the index have decent credit metrics which makes them interesting portfolio diversifying options.
"
"Strong As ABull. We already mentioned that the roll took place last Thursday. The 5 year risk premia shown in DataGrapple are today 3 months longer than they were a week ago. As a rule of thumb, this 3-month-extension is worth 5% of a risk premium. So one would reasonably expect them to be a least a tad wider than they were on the 17th March. But with the exception of the High Yield space in the US (where risk premia are 5bps or only 1% wider, which still implies a tightening on a constant maturity basis), other sectors are flat or even tighter. The outperformer is the High Yield universe in Europe (aka CrossOver) where 5 year risk premia are actually tighter. On average this space is 4bps tighter, which means an effective 6% reduction of risk premia. At the moment, each tentative move wider is met by a steady stream of protection selling. This market is strong as a bull.
"
"Is It A Pause?. Recently, credit was only knowing one way: tighter. But today, even though equities were marching higher, credit was unchanged. The fair value of the major indices was unchanged and the move of iTraxx Crossover was only due the basis converging towards zero. The iTraxx Financial Subordinated index was even a tad wider, as the new issue calendar has been very heavy recently, especially in the financial space. The AT1 compartment has been very busy, with 3 new deals today alone and a jumbo Deutsche Bank (5bln€) rumoured to reach the market very soon. With that supply which keeps coming and the roll come and gone, people are less hesitant about lifting CDS offers. It is a bit early to call it an indigestion, but the market definitely made a pause toady.
"
"Some Positions Still Need To Be Rolled. The volumes traded last week released by DTCC show that the week where the roll takes place is always a busy one for dealers. But they were probably a bit disappointed by the trading activity, given the important turnover the credit market has experienced since the beginning of the year. Volumes were far from what they were during the previous roll back in September, and it looks as if investors have not rushed to position themselves on the newly issued series of iTraxx and CDX. It could prove a good thing as off the run indices will keep trading for a while, making the market more diversified.

"
"Alpha Even When Markets Trade Sideways. Credit indices did not move that much today (even though volumes going through were healthy) nor did their fair value. But that do not tell the whole story, as some names experienced decent move. Utilities were weak across the board as they face regulatory pressure, as was confirmed by Ofgem proposing that the Competition and Market Authority investigate the UK energy market. ALOFP (Alstom SA) was also under the limelight after they were said to face wider bribe probe with the US trying to impose record fine. Its 5 year risk premium closed 13bps (65cts in cash price) wider. At the other end of the spectrum, financials are still feeling very strong. Senior protection is benefitting from the uninterrupted flow of subordinated issuance.
"
"If You Are Not Sure… Compress. The end of the quarter is dangerously close and no one wants to spoil the party. Most of the risky assets (at least credit and equities) in developed markets are flat or up on the year and investors look quite happy about it. As there was not much in terms of news on the macro or micro front, the path of least resistance was to push almost everything a tad higher. Since the beginning of the year, such an environment has been systematically synonymous of compression and today was no exception. iTraxx Crossover outperformed iTraxx Main, and iTraxx Financial Subordinated outperformed iTraxx Financial Senior. When there is no obvious reason to do otherwise, compression is at work.
"
"Another Strong Day For Xover Newcomers. Despite a small consolidation towards the end of the session, today was strong across the board. But one subset of names has performed particularly well: the names which entered the iTraxx Crossover index 10 days ago. Most of them are high beta, but they are perceived as good quality names, and investors are happy to get some yield together with some diversification. It is also worth noting that on most of these names, selling the CDS offers more yield than buying their bonds with an equivalent maturity. As long as these positive bases will be up for grab, there is all reason to believe that this outperformance will continue in a bullish scenario. 
"
"Index like a Steamroller.   The credit index is from time to time like a steamroller. When all investors are rushing to unwind macro hedges, the index is crushing all the single name CDS. However, the index face some resistance. The index is going too fast and the index basis start to trade negative. The on-the-run investment grade index basis   in Europe and in the US are both closing at -10cts. The indices are 10cts to expensive compared to their fair value, an equivalent of 2bps. Looking at historical value we are going to be close to the one year low. In this context, the basis is a compelling investment opportunity as a gamma play.  In any sharp widening, the index will underperform the single names. The basis as a limited downside on any grind tighter.
"
"Europe/US Convergence. When the series 20 was the “on-the-run”, the spread between iTraxx Main in Europe and CDX IG in the US, the 2 investment grade benchmarks, was relatively stable with the exception of 2 episodes (the EM related mini crisis in January and the Ukraine risk escalation early March) during which Main underperformed CDX. Since the roll in March, there is a completely new dynamics and the convergence between the 2 benchmarks has been impressive. From 9bps on the 20th March, the spread is now down to 5bps. The outperformance of iTraxx Main is due to the tightening of the risk premium of banks (which are not represented in the CDX IG index) but also to the performance of the peripheral names. Europe is no longer perceived as much riskier than the US, and the basis (difference between the quoted risk premium of an index and its theoritcal risk premium implied by its constituents) is in line on both indices, when it has historically accounted for a good part of the spread. 
"
"Xover Constituents Struggle to Keep Pace. After an hesitant start to the day, credit indices gradually traded tighter with market participants allegedly cutting hedges after Mr Draghi’s press conference, and all indices finished the day tighter. But the performance is less impressive if you look at what happened to the single names. If the investment grade universe benefitted from the momentum of the financial subset, the High Yield names (the iTraxx Crossover constituents) actually saw their 5 year risk premia increase as a whole. It could be that investors needed a pause before tomorrow’s NFP as the market has known just one direction since the beginning of the week. It might also indicate some market participants start to consider valuations as a bit rich, and begin to take chip off the table.
"
"Lafarge Cement A Merger With Holcim. Since mid-March when worries about a full blown conflict in Ukraine begun to alleviate, the risk premium of LGFP (Lafarge SA) has been on a downward trajectory, tightening from  228.5bps to 196bps. It was positively impacted during that period by the general hunt for yield which benefitted high beta names across the board. But today, it gained some impetus of its own following the news the Lafarge and HOLZSW (Holcim Ltd) are considering a merger of equal. On the back of this announcement, the risk premia of the 2 companies started converging aggressively, with LGFP’s 5 year CDS tightening a cool 60bps to 139.5bps while HOLZSW’s 5 year CDS widened from 105 to 111.5bps. One should not expect the 2 companies to trade much closer to each other until we have further details regarding this alliance.

"Anadarko (APC): Settling Is Good For You. Over the last few months, we had a litany of financial institutions agreeing settlements with the authorities in a variety of cases, ranging to accusation of market disruptions to misselling of financial products. The latest example of a company reaching a agreement with the government is APC (Anadarko Petroleum Corporation). They settled their long standing dispute over the Tronox case, a pollution issue finding its roots in the takeover of Kerr-McGee in 2005. It was feared at some stage the APC could face a bill in the region of $15bln, so the $5.1bln settlement was taken positively by the market as it removes one of the major uncertainties around APC. The 5 year risk premium gapped 20bps on the news, and is now trading at levels not seen since early 2010.
"
"Suedzucker and Bouygues in the News. The credit market closed almost unchanged on most indices, even though the range was 3bps on iTraxx Main and 10bps on iTraxx Crossover. This grapple shows that winners balanced losers and most investment grade names were little changed. The notable exceptions were names in the news: SUEDZU (Suedzucker Mannheim Ochsenfurt AG) spooked investors with a profit warning and slashed EBITDA estimates for 2015 on the back of increasing competition and rising inventories, while BOUY (Bouygues SA) was rewarded for considering the sale of their Telecom unit to Illiad. HOLZSW (Holcim Ltdtion) is still stubbornly refusing to go wider, as Moody’s said the merged entity with Lafarge would be in investment grade territory, forcing more shorts out of their position. 
"
"Who Wants to Buy Financial CDS?. Since the beginning of the year, iTraxx Main is unchanged. One could argue that it actually means risk premia are tighter as we have extended the on-the-run maturity. But in any case, that leaves a clear winner in 2014, the financial sector: despite the slightly longer maturity, its risk premium is 10bps tighter, with most of the move taking place since the last roll in March. Confidence in the sector has been restored with numerous issues of AT1 bonds and the recent release of the results of the central banks’ stress tests.  The forthcoming updated financial CDS documentation which will make protection more effective with the introduction of new credit events is certainly not helping either, as investors are not rushing in to buy protection which will become illiquid come September.
"
"Want To Visualize Curves? Here You Go. Since the beginning of the week, you can use this grapple to visualize curves. Horizontally, you find the level of the 5 year CDS. Vertically, you get the difference between the 5 year CDS and the CDS that matches the maturity you selected at the top right of the screen. In this instance, you see the 3y/5y risk premium curve as a function of the 5 year risk premium. This grapple covers the investment grade space in the US. It is striking to see that there is very little dispersion in this universe. The 3 year risk premium is worth 50% of the 5 year risk premium, whichever name you are looking at. It is even more striking to see that it is always the case. Indeed, each dot represents today’s situation. The line that ends with the dot shows you how the curve you are looking at has been moving over the selected period. For instance, if you click on the green dot in the upper right corner, you see that SWY (Safeway Inc, the name appears at the upper right corner of your screen) has been moving nicely on that diagonal during the last year, even though the 5 year risk premium has been multiplied by 2 over that period.
"
"Wobble or Inflexion Point?. Today was the first sizeable move wider in credit spreads since the launch of the most recent series of indices. The move was broad based and hardly any name was spared. That said, it was orderly and happened during the morning, while most of the afternoon was spent in a fairly tight range (1bp on iTraxx Main and 4bps on iTraxx Crossover). So far, the trend is still towards risk reduction and deleveraging rather than new positions being added. It is therefore easy to spot crowded longs (which are underperforming) and crowded shorts (which are hardly moving despite the general widening).
"
"What Volumes Tell Us. Credit indices opened at the widest levels of the day but ground tighter throughout the session to close at the tights. The results of Citi, which were better than expected, probably helped a little bit along the way, as did US statistics painting a more robust economic picture that investors anticipated. But the trading activity was subdued. That stands in sharp contrast with busy trading sessions since the roll, as recently shown by the DTCC volumes regarding the week ending on the 4th April, during which volumes were very healthy and stood substantially above similar periods over the last few years. Short risk positions were unwound during the last fortnight and some pain was taken as it took place at the tightest levels of the year. But it is difficult to read much in today’s move tighter as only few trades went through.
"
"Positioning-led Decompression. A fairly dull day was eventually brought to life by geopolitical worries. Most of the session was spent in a tight range on credit indices until the last couple of hours, when news of heavy fighting in Ukraine broke out. That brought buyers of protection to the market, and the move was quite telling about positioning. Numerous investors have added to compression positions recently, and some were quick to start the unwind process. iTraxx Crossover was the clear underperformer of the day, on the back on that. So today’s price action was driven by technicals, and tomorrow could be no different. It will be option expiry day, and if positions are light on the new series of indices, they appear heavier on series 20 in Europe and series 21 in the US. Gamma negative positions have been accumulated by the dealer community on the 250 strike in iTraxx Corssover 5 year series 20 (ITXEX20) and on the 80 strike on the iTraxx Financial Senior 5 year series 20 (ITXES20). We are getting dangerously close to these levels, and the widening could get further momentum if they are broken.
"
"Hedged and Wedged. Over the last 2 sessions, the Itraxx Crossover index has widened by 13bps yesterday and then tightened by 11bps today. During these 2 sessions, the fair value of the iTraxx Crossover index derived from the quoted prices of its constituents has barely moved and all the volatility came from moves of the basis. The basis is strongly mean reverting but during sharp moves of the credit market, indices tend to react faster. Investors using indices to hedge portfolios of single names know that these assets move together and that the relationship between their respective prices usually does not break for long period. But at times, they can feel hedged and wedged. 
"
"JNY In Unchartered Territory. Sycamore Partners, the private equity firm,  offered to acquire JNY (The Jones Group Inc) back in December 2013. Since the deal was officially approved by JNY’s shareholders early March, the 5 year risk premium has been on a steady path and has risen consistently despite the general move tighter of the credit market. JNY’s risk premium previously belonged to the 350-450bps category. But as is often the case, once that 350-450 range is broken, 450-550 is a kind of no man’s land and the widening trend is tough to reverse until the risk premium reaches the next level which consists in trading in points upfront. This eventually happened to JNY yesterday, and it closed today at 3.25pts (or roughly 625bps using our convention of 100 coupon for the 5 year CDS). We should now see high yield buyers of risk emerge, who can try and catch what has been so far a falling knife.
"
"Pfizer (PFE): Cheap Short?. The week-end was rich in M&A; stories in several sectors, but the eye popping numbers definitely came from healthcare. Activist investor Pershing Square Capital is joining forces with Valeant Pharmaceutical to acquire Botox maker Allergan for a cool $45bln. The other mega deal which could be in the cards involves PFE (Pfizer Inc.) targeting AZN (AstraZeneca Plc). Rumours linking the 2 giants have been on and off for a few months now. With PFE rumoured to be the buyer and its prey being a $100bln company, some have been recommending buying 5 year CDS, arguing that a 25bps risk premium is low enough to make it a cheap option. But one has to look at the upside potential of such strategy, and moving meaningfully the 5 year CDS of a $200bln company requires a lot of additional debt. The amount of protection one has to buy to make the potential return attractive might not make it such a cheap short after all.
"
"Indices and Single Names Divergence. When you look at this grapple which clearly shows that the risk premia of single names kept their recent positive momentum, it is difficult to imagine that credit indices closed wider across the board without exception. Investors still do not see any default occurring in the current environment, thanks to the unlimited liquidity available to corporates as evidenced by the recent Altice jumbo deals, and they have given up buying protection on single names at the moment. But people do not feel completely at ease with the level of the market. Even factoring in any potential QE by the ECB in the future, the performance of credit assets since the beginning of the year, but particularly since the roll, is impressive. The temptation to take some chips off the table proved too hard to resist for some, and, for that purpose, they used the most liquid instruments, credit indices.
"
"Alstom (ALOFP):Not For The Faint-Hearted. The focal point of the credit market during the European hours was ALOFP (Alstom SA) whose risk premium continues its rollercoaster ride. Overnight Bloomberg published an article mentioning that GE (General Electric Company) would be mulling over a $13bln bid for the French company. That sent the 5 year CDS tumbling tighter at the open, and the first transactions took place around 80bps, a healthy 120bps tighter than the previous day’s close. It eventually stabilised around 110bps, after it emerged that GE might only be interested in the energy assets of ALOFP and people begun to affect probabilities to the different possible outcomes (deal with GE going through, emergence of another suitor, selective sale of assets, nothing happening, …). In any case, ALOFP owning “sensitive” technology and being French, a takeover will not be a walk in the park. It will take some time and there will be more twists. After the dramatic 5 year CDS move which followed January profit warning, it is the second move in excess of 50bps of ALOFP’s risk premium. Things will certainly calm down a bit before volatility resumes, but investing in ALOFP is not for the faint-hearted.
"
"ITXEB vs CDXIG: The Domino Effect. The situation in Ukraine has brought some volatility to the market over the last few days. There was no panic so far, but investors have been looking for hedges against a potential deterioration of the situation and quite a few of them have chosen options on credit indices. They bought payer options (which give the buyer the right to buy protection at the maturity of the option) on iTraxx Crossover series 21 (ITXEX21), and also on iTraxx Financial Senior series 21 (ITXES21). The latter were the most popular, and that generated a negative gamma position within the dealer community. So today, when the market felt weak and tested recent wides, dealers felt the need to buy iTraxx Financial Senior aggressively which led to its underperformance compared with all other indices (it widened at the same speed as iTraxx Financial Sub when the ratio is usually 1:1.5). In turn, this underperformance impacted iTraxx Main. Such phenomenon seems to be the main driver of the recent widening of the spread between the US investment grade index (CDXIG22) and its European equivalent. From a tight of 3bps 10 days ago, the CDXIG/ITXEB spread closed at 6.5bps tonight.
"
"Today, It Was All About M&A . The week-end did not bring any major piece of news regarding the situation in Ukraine, and investors decided to remain on the side lines. A good portion of them were just back from their Easter break, and they were probably glad for that opportunity to catch up with the market. So, during a session which felt pretty dull, it is not very surprising to see that the outliers are involved one way or the other in the recent flurry of M&A; activity. In Europe, ALOFP (Alstom SA) ‘s risk premium was almost 20bps tighter as the bid from GE (General Electric Company) has not been rebuked by the French government. In the US, TWC (Time Warner Cable Inc) ‘s 5 year CDS was 8bps tighter after CMCSA (Comcast Corporation) announced they will sell customers to ease the path of the TWC deal. And at the other end of the spectrum, NEM (Newmont Mining Corp) ‘s 5 year CDS was 30bps wider after they ended merger talks with ABX (Barrick Gold Corp).
"
"Utilities: Compression At Work. Over the last month, the hunt for yield has been on pretty much across the board. It has been particularly obvious in one sector: utilities. The performance of the peripheral names has been impressive indeed. The result is a sharp decrease of the dispersion of the higher beta names. Previously there was a group of “core” names (whose 5 year CDS is worth 60bps roughly) and an heterogeneous group of high beta names whose 5 year CDS were spread between 85 and 95bps. Now, in Europe, the 5 year risk premium of a utility can only have one of two values: 60bps or 75bps.  That means there is no longer any distinction between core and peripheral among the higher beta names. On the back of that, relative value trades are currently advertised to play a return to a more discriminating environment.
"
"Collapse of the Crossover Roll. When the new series of indices were issued in March, the 5 year risk premium of the iTraxx Crossover series 21 (ITXEX21) was 70bps wider than the 5 year risk premium of the series 20 (ITXEX20). This spread is known as the “roll” between the 2 series. The new names which entered the series 21 (the number of constituents was extended from 50 to 60) were higher spread names, as they were picked among the less liquid European high yield population. Investors’ unabated appetite for risk over the last month has sent the risk premia of these names much tighter. If you add the effect of M&A; activity (proven in the case of ALOFP (Alstom SA) or anticipated in the case of PFOURS (Play Finance)), it does not come as a surprise that the S20/S21 Crossover roll has been crushed, trading down to 47bps today. What is a bit more surprising is to see that the risk premium of the older series have actually increased over the same period. Maybe people realised that short dated protections should not be worthless, even if they represent far out of the money options.
"
"Technical Levels: Do They Matter?. A wide array of assets are now trading near their post crisis high, and in some cases they are close to historical highs (US equities among others). They have been bouncing off those levels a few times, and credit is not different. The 5 year risk premium of investment grade names, as represented by the iTraxx Europe Main (ITXEB21), is testing the 70 level for the third time in a month, and investors are wondering whether we are at a crossroad. Is the market going to fail to clear this level and go back its previous equilibrium range of 75-85bps? Or is the market going to establish new tights and head decisively towards 60bps? Chances are that credit will stay close to current levels, within a tight 68-73bps range, until the numerous bank holidays are behind us. 
"
"Dwindling Volumes. Kids were on holidays around Europe last week, and that definitely played a part in the declining volumes we witnessed at the end of April. But even though they were back on Monday, and their parents back at their desks, trading activity was not any higher since the beginning of the week. Mid-week bank holidays around the globe did not really help either, but that sounds more like an excuse for the lack of conviction obvious in most part of the market than anything else. Risky assets have been rising across the board and no one complains about it, but investors do not feel completely at ease. This lack of conviction directly translated into lower volumes, which every now and then lead to burst of volatility. Until investors get a better grasp of the shape of economies around the globe, one might expect gappy price action in credit to persist.
"
"Bull Flattening? A Bit, But Not Much. Since the roll, the performance of credit has been almost uninterrupted. 5 year risk premia have tightened in a straight line and are now 13% lower than they were on the 20th March. In such an environment, one would expect CDS curves to flatten, as the different maturities usually move homothetically. But the current low default environment which has been prevailing for quite a while is not enticing investors to buy short dated protection. CDS with a maturity of up to 3 year have not found any takers in the recent move and curves are very steep across the board. 3 year risk premia have decreased by 18% since the roll. On a number of names, the move tighter combined with steep curves now makes short dated protection a compelling option to smooth the volatility of any portfolio if the market were to follow a bumpier path in the future.
"
"No One wants To Catch A Falling Knife. This grapple sums up some of the overarching themes which have been at play in the market over the last month. First compression has been in full swing. There is now very little dispersion in terms of risk premia between the different sectors. They have all converged towards the level of the investment grade index, ie roughly 70bps for the 5 year maturity. The other salient feature is the outperformance of the financial sector. During last month, sellers of protection on financial names have emerged in the market and dealers have been overwhelmed by the amount of CDS they had to buy. Fortunately for them, there were some hedges against a deterioration of the situation in Ukraine which were bought using options on the Financial Senior Index (ITXES), which in turn generated some buying cares on the Index, which in turn generated some bids for protection on the index constituents on the back of basis arbitrage trades. But these only managed to prevent a complete collapse of the risk premia across the financial sector. Natural buyers of financial protection are few and far between, as no one wants to catch a falling knife.
"
"Capitulation?. The market opened with an indifferent tone. Despite the positive tone in the US overnight, protection was trading sideways, pretty much unchanged from the previous day’s close. This was true throughout the morning session, and the range was very narrow until the ECB conference began. When Mr Draghi made a seemingly innocuous comment about being ready to cut rates at the next meeting if required, he set risky assets on fire and credit happily took part in the rally. As investors admitted recent psychological levels had been broken for good (70bps on iTraxx Main 5y and 275bps on iTraxx Crossover 5y), proper capitulation on short risk positions begun and people started hitting bids on protection as if there were no tomorrow. Credit indices eventually ended the day at levels not seen since the beginning of the crisis… not the sovereign crisis in 2011, but the subprime crisis in 2007/2008.
"
"Indices: They Bull Flattened. We commented recently the fact that single name CDS curves only marginally flattened during the move tighter which took place over the past few weeks. It is a somewhat different story on indices, at least on the short end. If the 5 year 10 year curve has been pretty resilient on the investment grade indices (iTraxx Main in Europe and CDX IG in the US) and is still trading at the same levels as a month ago (the 5y/10y iTraxx Main is currently worth 45bps against 46bps early April), the 3 year 5 year curve has flattened more meaningfully. 3y/5y iTraxx Main is currently trading at 28bps against 32.5bps right after the roll. This can be illustrated by plotting the behaviour of the 10y maturity of the different series of  iTraxx Main, the S10 10y being used as a proxy for the S20 5y since they have the same effective maturity. 
Selling 5 year CDS and buying 3 year CDS is a gamma positive position. If risk premia go to 0, which is obviously what the majority of investors think given the recent market trend, the 3y/5y curve will keep flattening and you will make money. If there is a bump along the road and uncertainty increases, then options become more valuable and short dated CDS are commonly seen as options on the health of the corporates. 

"
"Sky Has No Limit. If you have watched Saturday’s Eurovision song contest, you are certainly doubting the merits of European integration when it comes down to entertainment. Mr Ruppert Murdoch was certainly looking beyond that when he decided to consider merging BSkyB with the Pay-TV units of Fox in Germany and Italy. The idea is to transform BSkyB into a European TV giant, while leaving US based 21st Century Fox focused on entertainment programming. There was little concrete information regarding how the transaction could be structured or how this €10bln deal would be financed, but the leverage will increase compared with the current 1.2x, even if BSkyB’s stake in ITV were to be sold. In any case, investors did not wait long and the 5 year risk premium of BSkyB was marked 27.5bps wider at 79.5bps and could be heading towards 100bps if the deal proceeds, as a high yield rating is not ruled out.
"
"M&A, Main Source Of Action In The US. Over the last week, the credit market in the US has been very stable, especially in the investment grade universe. The fair value of the CDX IG 5y series 22 has barely moved, going from 63.1bps to 62.7bps. This index has moved a tad more quickly as the basis is now in negative territory and heads towards the 20cts level. But that stability at a macro level masks some dispersion when you drill down to individual companies. If most of the names were well behaved, others have experienced wild swings on the back of M&A; activity. SLE (Hillshire Brands Co) was the main casualty after the company announced their intention to acquire Pinnacle Foods Inc for $6.6bln raising questions regarding their future leverage and pushing the 5 year CDS 55bps wider, from 87.5bps to 142.5bps. At the other end of the spectrum, DTV (Direc TV) was the star performer after SBC (AT&T; Inc) said they are in talks to acquire the largest US satellite-TV provider, sending its 5 year risk premium 29bps tighter from 85.5 to 56.5bps.
"
"BNP: A Fine Mess. The 5 year risk premia of financial companies have been pushed agressively lower since the roll in March, trading down from 96bps to 70bps on average in Europe. Over the last week alone, they decreased almost by 10%. Peripheral banks have led the charge tighter, while reinsurers and insurers whose 5 year CDS are already trading at tight levels in absolute terms have been moving a bit slower. In other words, the tightening of the 5 year CDS was largely a function of the spread. There was one exception though: BNP (BNP Paribas SA). It was following the same path as the others until yesterday, when it was rumoured that the US administration is seeking $3.5bln from the French bank against the $1.1bln they have set aside for litigation. On the back of that, the risk premium gave back all its gain, which translates into a big candle on the left hand side.
"
"Many Shades Of Red. The market was getting accustomed to a grind tighter of risk premia in a low volatility environment. Maybe it got a little bit complacent recently, and it got caught off guard today. It is difficult to identify what the exact catalyst for the sell-off was, but the widening was broad based and gathered steam as the day progressed. Cash and CDS alike were under pressure, and even paper issued in the morning and massively oversubscribed (the perpetual bond brought by Axa saw a €7bln order book for a €1bln issue) fared badly in the afternoon (the Axa Perp was trading 0.25pt lower than its reoffer price). What is obvious from this grapple is the underperformance of the names which have been leading the recent march tighter. Financials together with corporates from the periphery are coloured with the brighter shades of red.
"
"It Was Not Plain Sailing Everywhere. If one looks at what happened with European credits since the beginning of the year, the market knew only one direction: up (or actually down if you look at risk premia). There were a couple of road bumps along the way, but investors hardly took their feet of the gas pedal. The story is quite different when one considers the high yield market in the US. A string of disappointing results among consumer cyclicals since Christmas in particular have weighted heavily on the sector, and the CDXHY is actually wider on the year. Investors had to rely on the carry of their positions to compensate for the widening of the index risk premium. The same is almost true for US investment grade corporates. People are still questioning the strength of the recovery.
"
"Torrid Time In The Periphery. Whichever the asset class, since the beginning of the year, the best position to have in your portfolio was to be long peripheral risk. That was until a few weeks ago. First, the stocks of Italian and Spanish banks begin to retrace part of their gains, and for a good number of them we are now firmly in bear market territory with falls larger than 20% from their peak. Then utilities and telco stocks also begun to slide, even though their move has so far been much more benign. The same is true for credit. Southern banks and peripheral corporates, which have been the star performers since the beginning of year, have gone through a phase of de-risking, and investors have started to take chips off the table. Decompression was also one of the themes of the last few trading sessions. For instance, while core banks were 6bps wider, South European banks were 13bps wider.
"
"Financial Led Consolidation. For a while, protection on financial companies was just impossible to sell. Investors’ sentiment was unanimously positive, and, with European QE in sight, it seemed that buying CDS was akin to throwing money out of the window. But last week, sentiment somehow turned on peripheral sovereigns with growth faltering in Europe. Italy, Spain and Portugal government bonds reversed course, shaking market participants’ confidence. That in turn hurt banks from the periphery, while banks from the core were impacted by noise around possible fine and/or actual settlement with the US authorities. The risk premium of BNP (BNP Paribas SA) for instance has increased by 14bps to 76bps during the last 5 trading sessions. So far it does not look anything more than a healthy consolidation, but a few assets are reaching technical levels. For the sake of long only investors, it would be best if they hold.
"
"Staples (SPLS) Stumbles… Again. During the first 4 months of the 2014, the 5 year risk premium of SPLS (Staples, Inc.) was on a steady path wider following a poor reporting season with regard to Q4 2013. Generally speaking, it was doom and gloom among most of the retailers and they have been one of the sectors which slowed the tightening of US credit indices. Then, as the tide eventually lifts all boats, the 5 year CDS of SPLS recovered during the good run of the CDXIG, the US investment grade credit index, which begun mid april. But yesterday reality struck back with the release of yet another disappointing set of results. Earnings missed analysts’ consensus and sales were guided down for the remaining of the year. 5 year CDS added 20bps of the news, and it looks as if it could test the recent wides of 270bps. If it breaks that level, it will be a leap into the unknown, with some analysts considering a 600bps 5 year risk premium a distinct possibility.
"
"CDXHY22 Back To Its Issue Price… Not. Today, the CDXHY22, the US high yield index, eventually traded through levels last seen at the very end of March when it was issued. And still risk premia are effectively wider… The very last drop is actually a purely technical effect, due to the default of TXUE (Texas Competitive Electric Holdings Company LLC) which has settled yesterday. On the back of this settlement, TXUE was removed from the index, which will comprise 99 constituents going forward as opposed to 100 when it was launched. As the expected recovery rate of TXUE has long been estimated to be very low, this name was weighting down on the index, and its removal makes CDXHY22 a much better quality basket. CDXHY22 initially included 100 names, which means each constituent represents 1% on the index. TXUE was roughly valued at 5cts on the dollar, so it was dragging the index price by 1%. If you look at the 5y index, that is the equivalent of 20bps. The drop in risk premium which took place yesterday from 351bps to 331bps on CDXHY522 is entirely down to the TXUE effect. A 20bps tightening in the 5 year risk premium of a credit index is not necessarily good news for investors. 
"
"A Little Uncertainty Ahead Of The W/E. Politics was back on people’s agenda this week. Numerous articles have been written over the last few days regarding the European elections (actually coupled with local ballots in a number of countries) and the impact they could have on the action and/or the stability of coalitions currently governing some countries. That might be a factor behind the wobbles of BTP this week and last which eventually affected most peripheral sovereign debts. That in turn had an impact on the risk premium of banks, but more generally on European names as a whole. During the whole period, US credit indices felt far less volatile and nervous than their European equivalent. And even though the market looked strong today on both sides of the Atlantic, the spread between the 5 year CDX IG series 22 and the 5 year iTraxx Main series 21 closed at almost 6bps today, when it was worth 3bps two weeks ago.
"
"SLE : Such A Ride Gives You Goose Bumps. A fortnight ago, SLE (Hillshire Brands Co) announced to the market their intention to acquire Pinnacle Foods for an enterprise value of $6bln. With the prospects of more leverage looming, investors sent the 5 year risk premium through the roof and it traded all the way up from 90bps to 140bps in very healthy volumes. Today,  Pilgrim's Pride Corp , a US unit of Brazilian meat company  JBS SA , made an unsolicited $6.4bln takeover offer (or $45/share) for SLE in order to derail their expansion plan. The stock of SLE traded instantaneously at the $45 offer level (22% higher than the level where  SLE’s stock settled post the Pinnacle deal announcement), indicating that investors believe in the success of this hostile take-over, and that they consider the Pinnacle deal dead. The press release indicated that the financing would be done through PPC, which seems to read that SLE would become an orphan reference entity. The reaction from the credit market was almost as fast, and the 5 year CDS of SLE traded all the way back to 90bps. It will eventually go lower once the deal is done and dusted.
"
"Is Volatility Dying ? . There has been plenty of talks recently regarding the very low volatility observed in the market. Over the last few days, Citigroup and JPMorgan even cited it as a source of concerns and guided down expected revenues from their trading desks. In equities, VIX is very near its all-time low at less than 12%. In credit, the basis (the difference between the theoretical value of an index computed with the prices of its individual constituents and its quoted value) is a good indicator of the velocity of the market. Indices are usually one step ahead of single names, and during phases of volatility, the basis tend to open. For instance, iTraxx Main S15 was the on the run investment grade index when the sovereign crisis broke out. During the market moves that followed, the range of its basis was close to 1%, trading between -50cts and +50cts. Since, basis ranges have progressively gone down. On iTraxx Main S21, ie over the last couple of months, the basis has traded between +6cts and -15cts. The market might not be complacent yet, but it seems to price flawless action from the central banks.
"
"Waiting For The ECB. This grapple illustrates the 2 main trends which have been at work since the beginning of the week. First compression was back with a vengeance. The results of the European elections were taken quite positively by the market, especially on the back of the support that Mr Renzi got in Italy. That enabled BTPs to make back whatever ground they lost during last week’s wobbles and peripheral names got a boost on the back of that. iTraxx Crossover which includes a good number of them is unsurprisingly the best performer of the last few sessions. Secondly, expectations are building that the ECB will next deliver a rate cut and some unconventional measures. Hence, investors have positioned themselves to benefit from an outperformance of financials names. They have options more than indices directly, but the subsequent dealer hedging activity led to the outperformance of iTraxx Financial (Senior and Sub) compared with iTraxx Main.

"BNP Under Pressure From The US. The financial sector was where the action took place today, even though at the end of the day only one name really moved. First Moody’s revised the outlook to negative on a number of European banks following the adoption of the BRRD, as they assess its implications for government support. That gave financial names across the board that light shade of red, while the rest of market was moving sideways and even a tad tighter for choice. But the real shocker was the size of the fine the US administration is trying to impose on BNP (BNP Paribas SA) according to an overnight WSJ article: $10bln, which is equivalent to 100bps of their capital ratio (it currently stands at 10.6%). Investors' confidence was shaken and the 5 year risk premium increased substantially. If bonds eventually settled and closed only marginally down as bargain hunters showed up, 5 year CDS was left bid and closed 6bps wider at 70.5bps.
"
"Orphaning Chatter. The market shown us today exactly how orphaning expectations can impact the risk premium of a reference entity. The first mover of the day was ALUFP (Alcatel Lucent SA) whose 5 year CDS traded up to 25bps wider as they announced a new dual tranche convertible bond. The widening took place in anticipation of hedging activity by CB buyers, but also because the CBs should be deliverable into ALUFP’s CDS. This alleviated recent fears that ALUFP could become an empty box. Conversely, AFFP (Société Air France) finished the day 30bps tighter as they announced a new issue which, according to some in the market, may not be deliverable into the CDS. This brought back the orphaning story to the fore, and the CDS, which is already pricing in a decent probability of this happening, received another nudge.
"
"Growing Expectations Into The ECB. Over the last 3 weeks, since BTPs touched a low of 122, expectations around the ECB meeting which will take place on Thursday have been growing. There is an overwhelming consensus that both a rate cut and unconventional measures will be announced. Economic data out of Europe have been uninspiring recently: employment and growth appeared subdued, and inflation has been undershooting expectations. So, according to the market, this combination is increasing the probability that the ECB will act decisively. First and foremost that translated into a solid performance of credit since May 20th, with iTraxx Main (the gauge for investment grade credit strength in Europe) tightening 6.5bps to 65bps (a level last seen in early 2008). Secondly, the spread between iTraxx Main and CDX IG (its equivalent in the US) has shrunk from 6bps to less than 3bps during the same period. 
"
"WINDIM (Wind): Chain Reaction. Credit had its usual grind tighter day, as the market is bracing itself for the ECB meeting tomorrow. The tone is quite bullish across the board, but moves were generally fairly contained. It took an overnight Reuters article to set things in motion in the European telco space. According to their sources, Hutchison Whampoa has resumed talks with Vimpelcom, the Russian telecom group, over merging their Italian mobile companies. These talks have been rumoured to be on and off over the last 6 months, with their reported break earlier in the year leading to a 150bps widening of WINDIM’s 5 year risk premium. This time, the clearance of Hutchison’s O2 Ireland acquisition, together with the recent partial refinancing of Wind’s debt, seems to create a new momentum for the deal to happen. On the back of that, the 5 year CDS of WINDIM was almost 90bps tighter at the end of the session. As is often the case, other possible concentration candidates in other regions joined the party, notably PFOURS (Play Finance) which closed 20bps tighter by sympathy.
"
"In A Straight Line. Today Mr Draghi delivered his much anticipated package to prevent the euro zone from entering deflation. As expected the morning was quiet ahead of the ECB meeting, but after what can only be described as a comprehensive offer (targeted LTROs, extension of full allotment, suspension of sterilisation, depo/refi rate cut and preparation for ABS QE), credit indices shot to new tights. It is now 3 weeks that credit has been moving in a straight line, and all indices are today trading at levels not seen since the beginning of 2008. But the most striking feature of this grapple is the convergence of US and European Indices. The big difference between the 2 is the inclusion in iTraxx Main of European banks, while their US counterparts are excluded from CDX IG. The main beneficiaries of today’s decisions are clearly financial institutions and credit investors were quick to recognise that.
"
"Who Benefited From The ECB Bonanza?. There is a debate among analysts regarding what the impact on the real economy of the set of measures announced by the ECB yesterday could be. Some are convinced lending will get a boost, others are more sceptical. But one result is obvious for everyone: financial assets have massively benefitted from the ECB bonanza, and particularly credit markets. Every single index, both in the US and in Europe is tighter over the last couple of days, and among them iTraxx Financials Senior (ITXES) and iTraxx Financial Sub (ITXEU) have been the outperformers. A typically aggressive speech by Mr Draghi has caused investors to scramble to get their hands on risk, and the pre ECB headlines regarding banks fines that once worried the market are long forgotten.
"
"Dixons: Nothing Is Done Until It Is Done. Given the global picture, some news was definitely needed to justify any widening. This is what we got on DXNSLN (Alcatel Lucent SA). There were articles in the week-end press reporting that Everything Everywhere (EE), the joint-venture between Orange and Deutsche Telekom, might be considering to end their relationship with Carphone Warehouse (CPW). On the back of that, the GBP3.6bln merger between CPW and DXNXLN could be under threat, as losing EE would undermine CPW’s position as the leading retailer for consumers to compare network deals. This potential merger sent DXNXLN’s risk premium from 250bps to 200bps when it was announced. Unsurprisingly, today DXNSLN’s 5 year CDS was the outlier and closed the session 10bps wider. 
"
"High Yield Names Looking For Liquidity. Credit markets traded mainly sideways today. Daily variations on the indices were minimal and fair values did not move much either. If you add to that the fact that there was hardly any idiosyncratic news, one would expect individual variations to be contained. And still some names have been pushed around, experiencing meaningful variations. Nevertheless, trading volumes were not huge on these, and most of them are found among the new constituents which entered iTraxx Crossover during the last roll. It mostly shows that liquidity on these newcomers to the CDS market is still a bit patchy. If there is no big general market move, you need to cross the bid-offer to move a position, hence creating some noise in the price time series.
"
"Spring Cleaning. New rules regarding capital requirements are gradually sinking in with investment banks, and we have had a series of announcements made since the beginning of the year regarding institutions getting rid of activities and their associated positions in non-core areas. Derivatives have been a particular focus, and credit derivatives have seen such “cleaning” taking place as well. Most of these transactions are done in a secretive way and the general population generally does not see them. With transactions reporting rules, they are still retrospectively obvious for all to see, as this kind of portfolio operations involved big notional changing hands. If some spikes in volumes can be linked with market moves or technical activity (CDS roll in March), others have no other explanation. It looks as if a very comprehensive cleaning operation was successfully undertaken at the beginning of May.
"
"ITXEB: The Basis Will Not Protect You. Credit indices have now closed wider during a number of sessions (5 in a row). Not surprisingly, while some people have obviously been looking for a way to take chips off the table (and indices are arguably an efficient way to do so), others are considering bottom fishing. The argument among the latter revolves around which index they should choose. Some dealers are advising clients to use the basis to theoretical prices as an indicator, and hence favour selling protection on iTraxx Main (ITXEB) to go long risk as the basis has been creeping higher recently. But at a paltry 5cts, the basis does not provide you with a substantial cushion and is still far off the levels it usually reaches when the market is under any kind of stress. In January for instance when the Emerging Market mini crisis broke, the basis of ITXEB went to 27cts. Current basis levels look reasonable across the board, and should not be used as a guide to make a directional punt on the market.
"
"Liberty In Play?. At the moment, the credit market is keeping a close eye on equities. It seems that as long as stocks are holding to their current levels, it will not go meaningfully wider. So as long as the current M&A; frenzy will last, nothing bad can happen. But M&A; is also having an impact on individual names. Speculation about M&A; is actually enough in some cases, as the example of the Liberty complex shows. Rumours linking Vodafone to VMED (Virgin Media), to IESYRP (Unity Media), to UNITY (UPC Holding B.V.) or the whole of Liberty have been rife recently. They had some more airtime today, and the rally was broad based on all these names and their whole capital structure. Longer dated bonds were the outperformers, but 5 year CDS were 15bps tighter as well. 

"
"Airlines Could Be The Weakest Link. No one really expected a bumper day in terms of activity ahead of the FOMC tonight, and we effectively got a fairly quiet session. The trading range was very narrow on indices, with most of the activity concentrated on Main on the back of option expiry. Nevertheless the tone was supportive across the board and with the roll in a couple of days, protection was slightly better offered on most of the names. There was one sector under pressure though, as airlines’ risk premia are all closing wider on the day. This a trend that actually began a week ago with the consolidation of the market. But it also coincided with the escalation of armed clashes in Iraq which have pushed crude prices 5% higher. High yield air carriers are price takers as far as oil is concerned, and the credit market is singling them out as the most vulnerable. 
"
"Say “Thanks” To The FED. The performance of Itraxx Crossover constituents was impressive today. None of them saw its risk premium increase during the session. Investors took heart from the comments made yesterday by the FED chair Mrs Yellen that interest rates will stay rock bottom for the foreseeable future, and from the roll which will take place tomorrow on single names and which will introduce September 19 as the new “on-the-run” maturity for 5 year CDS. Despite that, it was still possible to identify a couple of standout outperformers. PORTEL (Portugal Telecom) ’s 5 year CDS closed 33bps  tighter at 203bps on the back of its rating upgrade by Moodys to Baa3 late yesterday. SUNCOM’s 5 year CDS closed 41bps tighter at 240bps after overnight reports that CVC, its sponsor, could be looking for an exit, either via an IPO or through a merger with Orange.
"
"Today Was Roll Day For Single Name CDS. Today the 5 year “on-the-run” maturity for single name CDS has moved from June 2019 to September 2019. Accordingly, the maturity of the risk premia displayed by DataGrapple was extended by 3 months and one would expect these risk premia to be wider by roughly 5% in a stable market (if you assume linearly increasing risk premia, 3months is 5% of 5 years). This is what happened in the financial sector which for once was surprisingly rational, with most of the single names in that space rolling up their curve. Names in other sectors experienced a slightly more bullish roll and ended the session less than 5% wider on the 5 year CDS point, despite indices (whose maturity were not impacted by the roll) ending the session a tad wider across the board. The direct effect was index bases to theoretical closing wider on the day on all indices.
"
"ALOFP’s Fate Is Now Sealed. With credit indices trading sideways for most of the session (even though with a weakfish tone until the release of US home construction figures), some idiosyncratic news was need to push a name one way or the other. While WINDIM’s 5 year risk premium was 16bps wider after it announced a $5.5bln multi tranche deal to refinance debt, the 5 year CDS referencing ALOFP (Alstom SA) was 6bps tighter. During the week-end, GE (General Electric Company) was endorsed by the French government (they had already won Alstom’s board’s heart some time ago) as their preferred bidder. That brings an end to a bidding contest which investors feared could drag for much longer. The exact structure of the deal and the eventual leverage of ALOFP going forward is not 100% clear, but an investment grade rating at some later stage is now taken for granted.
"
"A Profitable Week For Credit Longs. It is slightly less than a week that the most recent single name roll took place. Datagrapple graphs the “on-the-run” CDS maturity, which means that for 5 year we have moved from June 2019 to September 2019 between the 17th June and today. Despite this maturity extension and upward risk premium slopes, two third of the names have seen their “on-the-run” 5 year risk premium decrease over the last week. This grapple shows that most names have moved of their tightest level, but nevertheless credit had a very good run across the investment grade universe. If you factor in the roll-up the curve (which accounts for roughly 5% of the 5 year CDS spread), all names are effectively tighter.
"
"Basis Dynamics Through The Roll. Single names CDS rolled on the 20th June as they do each quarter, and the most liquid maturities have been pushed by a quarter. For instance, the “on-the-run” 5 year maturity is now September 2019 while it was June 2019 a week ago. Credit indices on their side only roll twice a year, and the “on-the-run” 5 year investment grade index is still iTraxx Main S21 with a June 2019 maturity. On indices, on the 20th June, dealers just took things where they left it the day before and resume trading as if nothing had happened. On single names, dealers should have factored in their prices the maturity extension. But there is always a tendency to leave their 5 year quotes unchanged, or at least a tendency not to reflect fully the increase in risk premium coming from the 3 months added to the maturity of new on the run contracts. This is particularly true in a bullish environment, like the one which prevails at the moment. This grapple shows that this naturally led to an increase in the basis between credit indices and their theoretical values.
"
"Monolines On the Move. If the market as a whole has been well behaved over the last quarter even taking into account the brief spell of aggressive tightening which followed the ECB meeting at the beginning of June, there are still some pockets of volatility, some due to sovereign wobbles. Argentina experienced some fierce moves after the US Supreme Court rejected their demand to overturn a ruling that may force them to pay billions of dollars to holders of repudiated bonds. Yesterday, Puerto Rico pushed through a legislation enabling the restructuring of the debt of some public corporations. Part of the thesis of investors who were bullish Puerto Rico up to this point has been that the latter have a strong willingness to pay their debt. It is not that obvious any longer in the light of yesterday’s legislation. On the back on that, all the monolines which are heavily exposed to Puerto Rican debt took a beating. MBIA (MBIA Inc), AGO (Assured Guaranty Ltd.) and FSA (Assured Guaranty Municipal Hldg Inc) all saw their risk premia dramatically increase.
"
"Financials’ Shine Is Wearing Off. Depending on the horizon you are choosing, this grapple paints a very different picture. Since the beginning of the year and until recently, financials have been everybody’s darlings. They have had a very good run, particularly after banks were identified as the main beneficiaries of the ECB measures announced early June, and they are the best performers year to date. But recently a string of events have started to take some of their gloss off. First CS (Credit Suisse Group AG) had to settle with the US authorities regarding a tax evasion case and had to pay a fine in excess of $2bln. Then BNP (BNP Paribas SA) was accused of violating US sanctions and could face a $9bln penalty and a ban on certain trading activities. And now BACR (Barclays Plc) is facing embarrassing revelations regarding the way its dark pool was managed. So much so that banks have started to drag financials’ risk premia wider since the beginning of the week. They are the worst performing sector over the last five days, and the iTraxx Financial Senior index which was trading flat to the iTraxx Main index no long ago is now 5bps wider.
"
"PORTEL: Investing Wisely Is Tricky. It is nice to sit on an €8bln cash pile. But with interest rates at record low levels, if you want to earn a little something out of it, you cannot leave it on your bank account. This is probably what PORTEL’s (Portugal Telecom SGPS SA) treasurer had in mind when he invested €900m in Rioforte Commercial Paper, which is one of the holding companies in the Espirito Santo group. Over the last few weeks, rumours have been flying regarding Espirito Santo International, which owns Rioforte and which was said to be in financial difficulties and to present financial irregularities. Since the middle of last week, changes to the board of Banco Espirito Santo have brought even more question marks regarding the group. It looked inevitable that at some stage investors would start asking question about PORTEL’s investments. This examination begun on Friday and PORTEL’s 5 year CDS was marked 20bps wider. It continued today with another 25bps widening. PORTEL was upgraded to investment grade by the rating agencies as recently as last week, so this widening might be seen as an investment opportunities, but no one wants to catch a falling knife. 
"
"Banco Espirito Santo Set The Pace. There were plenty of positive moves which impacted constituents of ITXEX21 (iTraxx Crossover) in Europe. The 5 year CDS of CONVAT (ConvaTec Healthcare) gapped 50bps tighter on the back of headlines on Bloomberg suggesting that the owners have been approached by buyers and are also considering an IPO. CWCLN (Cable and Wireless Communications Plc) closed 20bps tighter as an article published overnight in the UK press reported that an American group would be bidding for the company. PORTEL (Portugal Telecom SGPS SA) erased yesterday’s move when the 5 year risk premium of Banco Espirito Santo (BES) ripped tighter. But all that was not enough to make iTraxx Crossover outperform iTraxx Main on a beta adjusted basis. The whole BES saga which spooked investors and led them to buy iTraxx Financial Senior protection during the last few sessions, completely reversed course today as risk changed hands with a new array of clients (US high yield and European distressed) looking at the BES risk. Subsequently iTraxx Financial protection was sold aggressively, and iTraxx Main was dragged tighter with it, outperforming iTraxx Crossover.
"
"The Return Of Alpha?. As a whole, the credit market was stable today, and the fair values of the different indices did not move that much. iTraxx Crossover was 1.5bps tighter at the close, but that masks a few disparities as this grapple shows with its red and green patchwork. PORTEL’s (Portugal Telecom SGPS SA) risk premium is still on a random path as investors struggle to get a grasp on the company’s links with Espirito Santo group. AFFP (Société Air France) and BAB (British Airways Plc) saw their risk premia tighten respectively by 20 and 10bps, as they benefitted from stabilising crude price and orphaning chatters (again). The 5 year CDS of OTE (Hellenic Telecommunications Organization S.A.) closed 10bps wider after the company announced a deal to refinance their 2015 and 2016 bonds. Idiosyncratic risk has made a comeback recently, particularly among high yield issuers.
"
"PORTEL’s Bumpy Ride. PORTEL (Portugal Telecom SGPS SA) is the only name to finish the day wider in the high yield European space. As a whole, the market was buoyed by more dovish comments from central bankers (after Mrs Yellen yesterday, it was Mr Draghi’s turn today). But the Portuguese telco company saw its 5 year CDS premium closed 3bps wider, at 244bps. It was actually much worse at some stage. It was trading at 255bps, in reaction to a statement by Oi, the Brazilian telephone company, saying they were not aware that their merger partner had purchased debt issued by Rioforte. Investors fear that it might jeopardise the deal between the 2 telco groups, or that it will at the very least make the whole process more complicated.
"
"Questions Asked About Financials. Yesterday, the ECB meeting went smoothly and the market was receptive to its dovish tone. The details regarding TLTRO which filtered were viewed as positive for EU banks, and that set the tone for a bullish session on Thursday. It was a slightly different story today. The US holidays meant a more challenging environment liquidity wise and the market struggled to absorb a large buying interest on iTraxx Financial protection, which led its underperformance. It is difficult to point to one particular catalyst for that flow, but a few recent events warranted caution. The Banco Espirito Santo story is still unfolding and rumours of accounting irregularities in the group and of debt restructuring are not helping confidence in the sector. Erste Bank, the Austrian institution, warned that fresh hits from Romania and Hungary would drive it to a record 2014 loss. That reminded investors that the crisis might not be over in certain parts of Europe. On top of that, next week the quarterly results circus rolls into town and it always add a bit of uncertainty in the market.
"
"Bull Flattening. Since the single name roll in June, the credit market has been in a bullish mode. The challenges posed by some financials (BESPL, BNP, CS to name a few and Erste bank even more recently) and the recent collapse of Gowex which reminded us that fraud can still take place (and is effectively the best threat to credit investors) did not manage to spoil the party thrown by central bankers. This bullish mood is obvious when looking at 5 year risk premia which are trading at their post crisis tights. When observing this grapple and using the 10 year indices of off the run series as proxies for investment grade credit risk premia at their effective maturity (the maturity of S20 10y is December 2018, the maturity of S19 10y is June 2018, etc…), one can also visualize the bull flattening that took place  recently. Yield hungry investors have decided to move further along the maturity curves, as 10 year risk premia are typically 75% wider than their 5 year equivalent. Portfolio managers are still reluctant to use leverage to increase the gross notional of their portfolio, but they seem fairly comfortable selling what can be best described as out of the money options.
"
"Want Some Carry? Simple: Sell Main. Over the last few trading sessions, decompression trades have been back in fashion. Investors have been using the most liquid instruments to implement these strategies. Index option relative value trades have been set up to September and December expiries. Investors bought payers on iTraxx Crossover and iTraxx Financial Senior, while selling payers on iTraxx Main to finance them. The strikes used were 25 to 30% out of the money. The more adventurous have used indices directly. In each case the end result was the same: buying pressure on Crossover and Financials protection and selling pressure on Main protection. These strategies should work in a weak scenario, but no one wants to bet against central banks, and most do not anticipate potential corrections to be long lasting. Hence liquidity will be key when the time come to take profit, and the market has not seen positions built on single names to the same extent. That translated into different index basis to theoretical behaviours. While the basis was stable for Main, it has opened up for Crossover and Financial indices since early July. 
"
"Curves Are Slower To Adjust. What this grapple shows you is fairly counterintuitive. Even though risk premia have risen (modestly) over the last few weeks, with almost all sectors trading wider than they were a month ago, the curves have not steepened. The difference between the 10 year risk premia and the 5 year risk premia are roughly unchanged across the board. If you look at the same grapple but on a 6 months time span, you will see that these curves have all meaningfully flattened during the good run of the credit market when risk premia decreased by roughly 15%. Most of the recent move wider took place over the last few sessions, and dealers have not yet adjusted the level of their 5 year 10 year switches, as it often only represents a second order move in the bigger scheme of things. That anomaly should soon correct itself if the change in the spreads direction is confirmed. If the weakness persists in the credit market, curves will be quoted steeper.
"
"Guess Which Indices Include BESPL?. Once again, today was all about BESPL (Banco Espirito Santo SA). The stocks of most parts of the group were suspended today, at least for the afternoon pending announcement regarding the restructuring of the debt of ESI, and potentially of other entities in the group. But CDS kept trading on BESPL, and it experienced another rollercoaster, finishing off the wides but still a good 30bps wider on senior debt. On this grapple, while we see that all series of iTraxx Financials Sub are trading wider than they were early July, it is all also quite obvious that series 14 and previous took a much bigger hit. They did so for a good reason: they include BESPL. What we can also see is that the older the series is, the larger the underperformance. It stems from the fact that in case of very adverse shock, the risk premium widens, but it also inverts on short dated maturities when expressed as a running spread.
"
"BESPL The Only Focus. There was only one topic in the market this week: the Espirito Santo saga and its implications for the different entities of the group, for their creditors, and what does it tell us about a possible end of the crisis. Every entities which have a link with Espirito Santo got punished (PORTEL’s 5 year risk premium ended the week 40bps wider and BESPL’s 110bps wider), but there were also collateral damages. Confidence in financial entities was shaken and their ability to exit the crisis unscathed was questioned. The convergence trade between iTraxx Main (ITXEB21) and iTraxx Financials (ITXES21) which everybody loved a fortnight ago did not look so appealing any longer and people rushed for the exit. From trading flat to each other, iTraxx Main and iTraxx Financials closed the session 10bps apart, which is the widest we have seen in a while. 
"
"Indices Are Moving On Their Own. Today was fairly slow in the credit space. The beginning of the reporting season has failed to grab people’s attention so far, and the only meaningful activity on single names was again to be found in the Banco Espirito complex. The group now has a new management in place, but roughly €900mln issued by Rio Forte are coming due tomorrow. There were clearly some portfolio adjustments made during the session before this deadline, and BESPL senior and sub, both on the CDS and bond side, were trading much weaker. But the woes surrounding the Portuguese banking group did not seem to really impair risk sentiment. Most investment grade credits were actually unchanged with very little volume going through, leaving the index fair values almost flat on the day. And indices even enjoyed a bullish session, as some hedges bought last week were unwound. That meant index bases to their theoretical values closed much closer to home across the board. 
"
"IMTLN Got Smoked. Today, RAI (Reynolds American, Inc) and Lorillard Inc. announced that they are proceeding with their merger, in a $27.4bln deal that will see RAI become a bigger competitor to U.S. market leader MO (Altria Group Inc). In line with recent press speculation, IMTLN (Imperial Tobacco Group Plc) will acquire $7.1bln worth of assets from the merged entity. In the process, IMTLN will lever up to a level that is not compatible with an IG rating, and the market has recently punished them for that, putting today the final touch to a 20bps widening in a little less than 10 days. But the company has clearly discussed the transaction with the rating agencies before the announcement, and Moody’s was able to reaffirm their rating very quickly, whilst putting them on negative outlook. That last bit is there to make sure that they use some of their ridiculous cash generation towards deleveraging and that they respect a strict timescale to do so. With that in mind, most of the damage to the 5 year risk premium of IMTLN might already be behind us.
"
"PORTEL: Heavy Volumes Support Volatility. Once again Espirito Santo Group and the related entities were the focal point today. It was mainly good news for a change though. BESPL (Banco Espirito Santo SA) could get a €2bln cash injection by 1 or 2 new shareholders: that sent the 5 year risk premium 90bps tighter. Oi and PORTEL (Portugal Telecom SGPS SA) have been quick to react to the likely default of Rio Forte. They announced that the terms of their merger would be amended (with the portion of the merged entity going to PORTEL’s shareholders reduced from 39.6% to 25.6% initially but with the possibility to be revised up according to the recovery of PORTELS’s investment in Rio Forte’s commercial paper), alleviating investors’ fear that it could be called off. That sent PORTEL’s 5 year CDS 40bps tighter. This is one of the biggest moves we have seen on the name since the roll, but 20bps daily changes have been fairly common place since news of the investment in Rio Forte’s debt surfaced at the end of June. Like many peripheral names, the performance of PORTEL’s credit instruments had been impressive to say the least, and complacency probably set in to some extent. Hence the need to make some adjustments to portfolios, and to hedge excessive exposures. Not surprisingly, the DTCC statistics regarding last week’s volumes which were released this morning confirmed that the recent boot of volatility was backed up by a very healthy level of activity.
"
"ITVLN In The News. Before the tragic news of the Malaysian airlines being downed weighted heavily on the whole market, today was a day where idiosyncratic risk was prevailing. Among the names in the news, ITVLN (ITV Plc) was one of the biggest movers. It emerged overnight that Liberty Global has acquired from BSkyB a 6.4% stake in the company for £481mln. Investors assumed that this will lead at some stage to a takeover of the company, even though it represents a large asset compared to Liberty’s size. If it was confirmed, in line with Liberty’s financial policy, the Opco would probably be leveraged (around 6 times was an estimated level) which would then inevitably lead to a widening of the risk premium, possibly to 250bps (if VMED is any guide). On the back of that, the 5 year CDS of ITVLN jumped 40bps wider to 128bps. Until now, ITV was an unleveraged asset, with only short dated bonds, and most people’s fear was orphaning. In the CDS market, being orphaned does not necessarily last forever.
"
"BPLN: The Effect Of Russian Sanctions?. So far the market has decided to largely ignore the sanctions which the US and European countries have begun to impose on Russia. It is indeed difficult to identify a clear trend that would affect financial or oil companies with exposure to Russia for instance. But some argue that the cumulative impact of sanctions is getting harder to ignore, particularly given the recent succession of events in Ukraine and the tragic downing of a passenger plane in Ukrainian airspace. Given its link with Rosneft (it has a 20% stake in the company), some people argue that these worries are behind the recent widening of BPLN’s (BP Plc) risk premium. The trend has been steady since early June, and accelerated during yesterday’s session as the 5 year CDS gapped almost 9bps. This name has now widened by 15bps (which represents a 30% increase compared with the recent tights) and no one has decided to take the other side of the trade yet, despite the best effort of a few dealers.
"
"DXNSLN: The End Of The (Debt) Journey?. For a long time, DXNSLN (Dixons Retail Plc) was a company everybody loved to hate in terms of credit. At one stage, it used to be on everybody’s list of LBO targets because of its once extensive network of retail centres. Then its business model was questioned because of the competition from internet retailers. But a new management team was brought to the company a few years ago, and the turnaround was fairly impressive. It recently culminated with the proposed merger with  Carphone Warehouse Plc. During the last few years, the deleveraging has been steady, and it was brought to a conclusion today by the redemption of DXNSLN’s last 2 outstanding bonds which were originally due to mature in 2015 and 2017. If the operation is successful, it will leave the company without any traded debt. The CDS market acknowledged that, and DXNSLN’s 5 year risk premium dropped almost 30bps to 78.5bps. But it is not worth 0. The buyers of protection are either cutting long risk positions initiated earlier or they are betting that some more debt could be issued at a later stage from this entity.
"
"What Negative Sentiment?. Recent phases of volatility proved that the market is a bit nervous currently, but it would be very difficult to argue that the mood is bearish. There is no momentum in the phases of weakness. Unless investors are consistently fed with negative news, risky assets are unable to go down. A day without news of the situation going worse in Ukraine and credit indices cannot move except tighter. A day without news regarding what is actually going to happen to the debt of the different parts of the Espirito Santo Group and iTraxx Financials Senior and Subordinated outperformed iTraxx Main. So today all risk premia went tighter in unison, and part of the decompression move that took place last week was reversed. It is summer and people would rather not get questions asked about their positions.

"VUE Did Not Enjoy The World Cup. In a session during which no macro news hit the tape, the theme was mainly “risk on” across the board. The move was not violent, but it was broad based. That said, there were a few exceptions, as the reporting season is now well into its third week and sometimes leads to some idiosyncratic moves. VUECIN (Vue) reported results for the second quarter of 2014, that were generally perceived as weak, with revenue declining 7% compared to a year earlier while EBITDA decreased 14%. Admissions were down 8.4%, and Vue also lost 0.7% market share during the quarter. And that was only until the end of May. The current trading statement given by the company indicated that the turnover was meaningfully impacted by the World Cup. Admissions for June were down 21% in England, 14% in Poland and 40% in Germany. I guess an all-South-American semi-final line up would have suited them better.
"
"A Day For Nothing. The very pale shade of green says it all… It was another day without big impact news, and the activity was subdued leading to contained daily moves. No sector stood out one way or the other and it is pretty much the same picture if you go step further by clicking on the “bomb” to get a more detailed view and see what happened to all the entities that compose the iTraxx Main index. You will see that BSY (British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc) outperformed slightly ahead its results tomorrow. Its 5 year risk premium tightened 5.5bps to 111bps as investors expect them to announce a new strategy alongside figures. At the other end, KINGFI (Kingfisher Plc) was 2.5bps wider following a poor set of results today, despite confirming their full year guidance. But this is as exciting as it got.
"
"BSY’s European Drive. Following weeks of speculations that drove its risk premium up and down over the last couple of months, BSY (British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc) eventually announced this morning the proposed acquisition of Fox’s 100% stake in Sky Italia and an offer for Fox’s 57.4% stake in Sky Deutschland. This was largely anticipated by the market. But the good news from a credit perspective was twofold. First the price paid for the assets came in at the low end of analysts’ expectations. Second, BSY announced the issuance of 156m new shares, for a total consideration of £1.4bln, which will significantly improve the balance sheet position. Together with the recent sale to Liberty Global of their 6.4% stake in ITV for £480mln, it will secure the investment grade status of the company going forward. The market shown its appreciation through a 30bps tightening of the 5 year CDS.
"
"CDS Metastability .   Looking back at what happened in the CDS market over the last month, the market appears to be trapped in a local equilibrium. All European sectors have traded in tight ranges compared to the recent volatility. Financials have traded in a 10 bps ranges while the other sectors have traded in less than 6bps. More investors are playing the tight ranges. But, this pattern of stability is rather unusual.  As a consequence, an outbreak of the recent ranges should be significant as a brutal freezing of below zero degree Celsius liquid water. 
"
"Hysteresis.   Before the financial crisis  the iTraxx  Europe index was trading through its fair value, the basis was negative. The CDX NA was trading wider than the European index and the CDX was trading more or less on its fair value. In April 2010, the iTraxx Europe started to trade above the CDX NA. The index started to be cheap to its fair value and the CDX more expensive.  Today, for the first time since 2010, the CDX fair value is wider than the iTraxx Europe fair value, but the iTraxx Europe is still wider than the CDX NA. Going back to a world where European credit is safer than the US credit, the basis do no revert in the same way. It is lagging as hedger are still focused on the European credit.  The index basis is still offering a credit neutral way to play the outperformance of the European credit versus the US credit.   Selling the iTraxx Europe (BTX) basis at 10cts and buying the CDX NA basis at -3.5cts is offering at 27cts pick up if both basis invert.
"
"X CDS more fragile than ductile. 
 X (United States Steel Corporation) surprised the market today with a second-quarter profit with cost savings and better pricing power. The CDS dropped 55bps and actually 80bps before the global market sell-off. A BB- high yield premium at 400bps over 5 years is pricing a 30% default probability for a total cost of 20%. This is a very expensive hedge. As a consequence, the CDS does no bend, it gaps on significant news either positive or negative.

"
"Quantum Leaps.  
End of June, the market discovered  BES (Banco Espirito Santo) issues. End of July, the market got a full picture of the losses (Angola risks remaining in the shadow) and BES equity is 50% down. This weighted a lot on the European credit market, adding the Argentina default, a rising view on stretched valuations and the CDS market gapped today by 3 sigma. We were used to such gaps in the past and maybe we thought this time was over. For such a valuation shift, the CDS market is not moving tick by tick but it is moving bid-offer by bid-offer, implying jumps and gaps on each CDS and even on indices.
"
"America is the weak link.  
It is not all about  BES (Banco Espirito Santo), looking back at past week CDS market variations, America is leading the market weakness, the high yield segment leading the investment grade. This trend started with the high yield outflows in the US with no buyer left on the market with the current valuations. The CDX NA investment grade generic contract is closing wider than the 31 December level at 67bps versus 63.5bps. The European credit is still better at 68bps versus 70.5bps.   The US investors are still positive with the carry and the roll down but there is little cushion left. 

"
"Dead Cat Bounce. 
 BES (Banco Espirito Santo) resolution is behind us. Equity and subordinated debt bond holders are sharing the loss. Depositors and senior debt bond holders are protected. Today, the European financial sector outperformed the market.  The market opened very firm but progressively widened as a dead cat bounce. The 70 mark is important on the iTraxx Europe index. It was a key resistance on the tightening during the spring. On the way out, a lot of trading should happen around this level.  

"
"US HY M&A.  The US High Yield complex has been under a heavy selling pressure in July. The asset class has underperformed most other asset classes. MNI (The McClatchy Company ) provided some relief in the HY market today in selling to GCI (Gannett Co., Inc.) its share in the cars.com company. MNI CDS is 100bps tighter and the CDS is correcting part of the recent weakness. MNI is a B- company, the cash should substantially improve its credit metrics. At the same time, GNI CDS is 10bps wider. GNI intends to split its publishing business (US TODAY) from its broadcasting and digital business and at the same time taking the control of cars.com. All in all, business simplification is good in an asset space under pressure
"
"Volatility and Volume.  
The market survived five active trading sessions since July the 31st  the start of the market correction with a 3 sigma widening in the credit space. Today, the market was again very volatile with the iTraxx Europe trading from 67 to 70, then rallying and closing just below 67. The iTraxx Xover is underperforming again today with a higher volatility than the iTraxx Europe. With the volatility the volumes are back.  The 
US indices are a little bit ahead of the European one, we will publish the same table next Wednesday to measure the increase of the hedging activity since the start of the week.

"Sell the Basis.  The iTraxx European basis is closing at 24cts or 5bps equivalent running spread. An investor can sell the index 5bps above its fair value excluding transaction costs. This is a very large level for the European investment grade CDS, the basis is 7% of the total CDS premium. Leveraging the basis 14 times, the investor return is similar to an outright credit investment without credit exposure and without market risk exposure. The only remaining risk is the basis risk but has the chart indicates, they are few point in the recent history when the market has traded as disconnected to the fair value as today. The picture is similar in the US but the basis is close to 15cts and there is room for another 5ct of basis widening.
"
"Just Europe.  The US credit market managed quiet well the geopolitical concerns over the last week. The US high yield market lead the weakness by the end of July. But this week, the US spreads have stabilized and the European market kept trading wider. Opening the grapple of the CDS performance and changing the time frame to “YTD”, we can observe that the US market is still underperforming the European market since the beginning of the year but the gap has narrowed substantially this week, European Xover names are in average 25bps wider while the US High Names are 3bps tighter.  
"
"Shale Gas On Fire. KMI ( Kinder Morgan Inc)  announced that it would buy out all of its publicly traded subsidiaries. The move by Kinder, who controls the entities through his 24% stake in the parent company runs counter to the industry trend of spinning off pipelines and oil terminals into tax advantaged partnerships that funnel cash to investors. By simplifying his empire’s corporate structure, Kinder will lower borrowing costs and unify the company under a single that he can use as currency to buy competitors, making it easier “to pursue expansion and acquisitions in a target rich environment” according to the company website. Overall, the company gave a leverage target of 5-5.5x and said all entities would be investment grade. KMI will use cross guaranties among the various entities to create a single creditor class with no structural subordination, on the back of what the spreads of KMI and EP (El Paso LLC) converged towards the spread of KMP ( Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP)
"
"Summer Liquidity. When you look at this grapple, it is difficult to imagine that all indices without exception closed wider on the day. And it has to be said that for most of the day, the tone was quite constructive on the market as a whole benefitting from the good session experienced by the peripheral banks. iTraxx Main protection felt offered for the best part of the session on the back of that. But a couple of hours before the close, credit indices began to drift wider for no obvious reason (there was no new development in the Ukrainian situation nor any macro or idiosyncratic news). Usually one would expect single names to follow suit at least to some degree, but not today. It looks as if investors were not really eager to buy protection from dealers and the latter were happy to wait until tomorrow morning for an overnight confirmation of this trend before reracking their levels. We shall see tomorrow whether indices go back to their recent grind tighter or if single names CDS play catch at the open. Today, the late move was only down to a widening of the basis between credit indices and their fair values.
"
"Volatility & Volume (from 4 to 8 Aug).  
After the flurry of activity due to the recent market volatility, DTCC published today the credit derivatives activity for the week ending the 8th of august. 
The European market closed at the widest level of the summer last Friday. As expected, the volume are increasing at 140BUSD per day (all indices included). 
This is close to the January level and one of the busiest week since the data are published  when excluding the rolls. 
 The indices are attracting all the hedging activity  when the cash is illiquid. The hedging activity focused more on the European market with trading activity up 50% compare the week before.
  The US hedging has stabilised and as a consequence the US credit out performed the European credit last week.

"Consumers Feel The Pain. Today’s session was broadly a continuation of what we have seen since the beginning of the week. A general trend lower as far as risk premia are concerned as some of the hedges put in place since the start of the month are coming off. But trading is mainly taking place on indices and single name CDS are still experiencing a typically poor summer liquidity. Most of the credits are indicated tighter by sympathy with indices, but some protections appear to be stubbornly bid. Some risks need to be recycled in the consumer sector in particular and protection on MRWLN (Safeway Limited) or SUEDZU ( Suedzucker Mannheim Ochsenfurt AG) are quite difficult to buy. And when a piece news hit the tape, CDS gap very easily. For instance, ELTLX ( AB Electrolux) closed the day 15bps wider after the company confirmed it is in talks to buy GE appliances business.

"
"Back To Square 1. People who are back from holidays and have left their office at the very end of July will find on Monday the credit market almost exactly where they left it. But it would be difficult to argue that nothing has changed. During the last 3 weeks, indices moves have been quite brutal, as spreads tightened from the wides as viciously as they widened on the way out. During the move wider, investors had a glimpse of what might lay ahead when tougher times arrive. On many instruments, the liquidity is questionable to say the least, and was nowhere near what was needed for people to sell their assets orderly, particularly on deeply subordinated papers. So far the market has taken comfort in the optically low level of leverage used across the board, but the mini crash made clear for everybody that when the leverage is embedded in the instruments you hold it does not make that much difference.
"
"The Volatile Summer of Bases. The basis between the indices and their theoretical value computed using the individual prices of their constituents is usually not a very useful indicator regarding the next move of the market. It merely tells you what the direction of the previous move was, as the single names’ velocity is lower than the velocity of indices. Because indices have been so range bound in the recent period despite some fierce moves, the changes in basis have accounted for a good portion of the total variation of indices. For instance, during the move that took iTraxx Main from 60 to 71 and back to 61 between the 23rd July and today, the basis went 0 to 24cts (or 5bps) and back to 2cts (or 0.5bps). The basis explains 50% of the move both on the way out and on the way in. While index traders exhausted themselves over the last couple of months, their colleagues who trade single names CDS had a much more chilled summer.
"
"Curves And The Impending Roll. Curves have always had a directional element. Since the beginning of the summer, the market has experienced some bursts of volatility, but there was no real credit concerns in the universe of names encompassed by the investment grade indices and all risk premia have been range bound. This is typically an environment where curves steepen when the credit market widens and flatten when it tightens. This has been true over the last couple of months, but recently curves remain unchanged across the board despite the resumption of the tightening trend. This is due to the proximity of the September roll. When the market will move to a new series of “on the run” maturities, the roll down will be less aggressive on longer dated contracts. The price difference expressed in running basis points between a 9.75 year and a 10 year maturity contract is smaller than the difference between a 4.75 year and a 5 year contract.
"
"Italian Banks and TLTRO. The activity was muted today, and the trading range very narrow. It was expiry day for options, and iTraxx Main and iTraxx Crossover were pinned at 60bps and 250bps respectively, which were strikes with huge open positions. On the back of that, they did not provide the market with any direction. Even if variations were marginal, one sector which experienced a bit of action was financials. An Italian newspaper reported that Italy 10 biggest lenders will seek €51.8bln in TLTRO funds. Italian senior bonds rallied as investors assumed that it will mean less supply from these issuers. CDS duly followed suit and banks enjoyed a positive session across the board.
"
"Close to the Tight of the Year?.  US equities are back on the high of the year.  In the credit space the picture is mixed. The subordinated CDS on financials are at the tightest level of the year. The new CDS definition schedule for the September roll will make the subordinated CDS “worthless” as useless there were in the Banco Espirito Santo special situation. The CDS moved to the Novo Banco while the subordinated bonds are still sitting at Banco Espirito Santo. The new contract should fit the new resolution regime for distress banks. The over performance of the financial sub is mainly technical, but the TLTRO explains also part of it. At the same time, the Xover Index is  still lagging the other indices despite some good news from SunCom (CDS -25bps) today. The Non Dealer/Customer community is still net long protection on the Xover for 4B€ according to DTCC. There is some room to tighten and compress but the investors are shy to add more risks ahead of September where some supply is expected. 
"
"Material Compression.  The  basic material sector is the widest sector in the European investment credit with Glencore (GLEINT) and Anglo American (AALN) trading in the 120bps context on the 5 year CDS. These names have a high beta versus the investment grade index. Today they are trading at the tightest level of the year while the index is closing 5bps off its tightest level @60bps. After a flurry of acquisitions after 2008, these companies are rationalizing their portfolios and they are less at risk of an economic downturn. The compression versus the other defensive names of the sector is significant but we could be close to the floor.
"
"Are Indices Getting Ahead of Themselves?. The credit market was closed yesterday for the most part and it had to play catch-up with other risky assets. The market now seems to be pricing a higher probability of QE taking place sooner rather than later following the dovish comments from Mr Draghi at Jackson Hole last Friday. It led to a very strong session for credit indices, particularly iTraxx Crossover which closed 18bps tighter. In a typical fashion, single names enjoyed a positive session as well, but at a far more moderate pace. The difference of velocity was such that the basis between the index and its fair value is flat, down from 50cts on Friday, and in any case quite far from its typical 40cts value. The recent price action makes buying protection on iTraxx Crossover a dangerous exercise, such was the bullish sentiment over the last 3 weeks. But if at the same time you can sell protection on its single name constituents for the same price, the probability of owning a winning trade looks very high. 
"
"New Docs And Liquidity . The statistics published by DTCC today confirmed what market participants felt last week: volumes have decreased steeply during the second half of August. Different bank holidays across Europe and the easing of geopolitical tensions contributed to the declines. But the most salient feature is the fact that iTraxx Financials (Senior and Subordinated) experienced the steepest fall in volumes. Like CDS referencing sovereign and a few corporate entities (INEGRP, AFFP, INTELSAT and VNU), existing trades on these two indices will not be fungible with trades made after the September roll when new CDS definitions will be introduced. Investors are understandably shying away from trading them, except for unwinding existing CDS transactions as liquidity on “old docs” contracts should be hampered going forward. Unless there is some serious worries around banks specifically, expect this trend to be confirmed when the next set of market data is released next Wednesday.

"
"Can You Trade This Basis?. Risk premium curves are flatter on the long end than they are on the short end, particularly for investment grade names. So as we get closer to the roll dates, the 5 year 10 year slope tends to steepen in an otherwise stable environment. Over the last month, iTraxx Main 5 year moved from 62bps to 59bps, while iTraxx Main 10 year moved from 100.5bps to 101.5bps, which is fairly consistent with that phenomenon. During the same period, single names hardly traded on longer dated maturities (between 7 and 10 years) and dealers have left their curves’ quotes unchanged on many of them. That led to an optically wide basis between iTraxx Main 10 year and its theoretical value, while this basis is worth less than 8cts on iTraxx Main 5 year. That divergence between the index curve and its fair value is an illusion : when checked on their actual offers on 10 year maturity CDS, dealers systematically rerack them wider. People selling steepeners on indices based on fair value are currently playing a dangerous game.
"
"A Month For Nothing?. Everybody will agree in saying that August has been a volatile month. The Ukrainian situation has generated numerous headlines which pushed the market up and down over the last few weeks and created some very abrupt moves. The outflows from HY funds in the US that took place in July impacted all market compartments and particularly the European High Yield at the beginning of August, but were quickly forgotten as there was no follow through, with all funds actually experiencing inflows afterwards. So much so that US HY ended up being the outperformer. But people who have been away for a month should not entirely rely of the benign picture painted by the monthly variations. The intense volatility of the recent period shown the market that liquidity dries up very quickly when investors rush for the exit and this certainly warrants a bit of caution for the times ahead.
"
"iTraxx Financial Basis Into The Roll. Since the series 21 was launched in March, investors have been aware that new CDS definitions would come in September and that they would mainly impact CDS referencing financial entities. It has not prevented investors from trading financial CDS because hedging and investing needs have not gone away, but it has certainly slowed single names’ trading activity. In any case it seems that some of this trading has been diverted to indices, which will remain liquid for a while, even when series 21 will not be “on the run” any longer. That might be a reason behind the stubbornly positive basis of iTraxx Financial Senior compared with its fair value. In spread terms, the index has been consistently trading wider than its fair value since the beginning of July. While single names’ traders are concerned with the roll down and only reluctantly bid up protection whose liquidity will be dramatically impaired after the 22nd of September, iTraxx Financial Senior has 2 sources of buyers: hedgers when the market is weak and investors who have been playing the compression against iTraxx Main when the market is strong. 
"
"In The ECB We Trust. Early August the market had a brief scare after some worrying outflow numbers from high yield funds and on the back of geopolitical uncertainties. Since then, outflows stopped (and actually reversed back to inflows), people decided to adopt a sanguine view of the Ukrainian situation, and they have focused all their attention to the coming ECB meeting which takes place tomorrow. After Mr Draghi’s speech at Jackson Hole a couple of weeks ago, investors appear convinced that European QE is on its way, and that assets’ pruchases will be announced tomorrow lunchtime. That has led to a pretty aggressive phase tightening and credit risk premia are trading close their tightest levels since the financial crisis started in early 2008. Any disappointment in the decisions made by the ECB or any glitch in the following press conference could translate into a volatile beginning of September.
"
"The Great Convergence. The ECB did not disappoint the market today. It delivered what people had been hoping for, i.e. a European version of QE, centred on ABS and covered bond purchases. Details will not be known until the 2nd of Oct, but Mr Draghi indicated that the ECB intends to increase the size of its balance sheet roughly to 2012 levels. TLTRO and assets purchase added together should just be shy of a billion euros. The ECB actually delivered even more, in the form of an unexpected rate decrease. The credit market celebrated these announcements in style, and iTraxx Main ended the day 2bps tighter at 56bps, which is the tightest closing level of the year. The major take away from the session is that now all investment grade indices are traded flat to each other. With Central Banks in action of both sides of the Atlantic (even though at different phases of their liquidity injection program), it is not surprising to see risk premia converge in the US and in Europe. ITraxx Main and CDX IG are now trading flat to each other, and in Europe iTraxx Financial Senior is almost flat to iTraxx Main.
"
"What Is The Colour Code?. In Datagrapple, the colour code is simple: if a name is red, its risk premium has increased (its credit spread is wider) over the period you are considering; if a name is green, its risk premium has decreased over the period. And the brighter the colour, the larger was the move. But since the beginning of the week, it can be read in another way. If a name is red, it is almost certainly a US entity; and if a name is green it has to be a European entity. And the brighter the colour, the larger the spread. It is also true if you look at the grapple showing today’s move by changing the time span to 1 day. A decisive step towards QE by the ECB on the one hand, and FED hawks becoming more vocal in the US on the back of data pointing to an economic recovery on the other hand resulted in European credits outperforming US credits.  It also led to spread compression in Europe and spread decompression in the US. While iTraxx Main has converged towards CDX IG, iTraxx Crossover has diverged from CDX HY.
"
"What If The Scots Say “Yes” ?. It was a generally quiet session as no geopolitical headline hit the wires, and no trillion asset purchase program was announced. The market had so far largely ignored the outcome of the referendum taking place on the 18th September which will decide whether Scotland will be independent for the first time in more than 300 years. A “No” to independence has largely been taken for granted until this week-end, when a YouGov poll predicted a “Yes” victory (a very narrow one and contradicted by other polls it has to be said) for the first time since such polls have been conducted. Such an outcome raises a number of questions regarding the future Scot currency, its central bank and interest setting policy among many others. Investors are not convinced all these issues have been addressed comprehensively. They think that business will inevitably be affected across the board. Financial institutions appear to be on the frontline and UK banks were unsurprisingly under pressure. 
"
"Wider Bases In A Risk Off Day. Today was another essentially risk off day. In a typical fashion less than 2 weeks before the roll, investors favoured indices over single names. They use the most liquid products, but mainly they use products whose liquidity will not be impaired after the roll. It is therefore not surprising to see that the bases of the most commonly traded indices have widened today. The odd one out was the iTraxx Financial Senior though. This is the sector where single names experienced the busiest trading sessions since the beginning of the week, after recent polls gave the “yes” and “no” going neck to neck in the referendum about Scotland independence. The coming changes in documentation will impact the liquidity of the current CDS, but the new contracts will only be available after the results of the 18th September referendum. That is why investors have been busy buying protection on banks over the last few days pushing iTraxx Financial Senior fair value wider. 
"
"Is iTraxx Wider Than CDX For Good?. Since the sovereign crisis which affected Europe, iTraxx Main has consistently traded wider than CDX IG. That was traditionally explained by the inclusion of banking institutions in iTraxx Main, while there is none in CDX IG. The spread between the 2 indices was as wide as 60bps at the end of 2011. The convergence has been a gradual process ever since as the crisis abated, and as the market rerated banks’ risk premia on the back of it. That said, whenever the market was under a bit of stress, iTraxx Main has been underperforming CDX IG, as banks were still moving with a beta higher than 1. Since the beginning of the week, this relationship did not hold. For the first time in a very long while, European investment grade credit has outperformed its US equivalent during a risk off move. But the normalisation will only be complete when the implied volatility of iTraxx options will be in line with that of CDX options, and no longer trades at a premium. iTraxx options are still 10% more expensive, which means that the market still perceive a greater risk in Europe than in the US. 
"
"Compression Helped By VOD. 2014 has been rich so far in mergers of all kinds. In an otherwise fairly calm session, it is therefore not surprising that investors can be fast to act when they hear anything pointing to a deal of some sorts. When the CEO of VOD ( Vodafone Group Plc) said today that Liberty Global Plc might be a good fit for the U.K. wireless carrier for the “the right price”, the whole Liberty sphere was set alight. VMED (Virgin Media), UNITY (UPC Holding BV) and IESYRP (Unitymedia KabelBW) were almost instantaneously 30 to 40bps, before settling 20bps, 15bps and 15bps tighter respectively. VOD on its side closed 6bps wider. In any case, there will be some hurdles to such a deal and it will not happen overnight, but it added fuel to the compression theory that has been advertised by some dealers on the back the recent ECB action. Indeed, iTraxx Main closed 0.5bps wider at 59.25bps while iTraxx Crossover closed 2bps tighter at 242bps.
"
"Calm Before The Storm?. When a 1bp move seems disproportionately important compared to the average sector move, that says it all. The session has been relatively quiet across the board, and the fair value of iTraxx Main was unchanged (-0.02bps) on the day. The worst performing credits were to be found in the mining and metal sector, with AALLN ( Anglo American Plc) and GLEINT ( Glencore Plc) under pressure on the back of the recent weakness in the commodities. But their moves were limited to 5bps. Investors have been busier squaring positions on indices, in anticipation of next week, which will be rich in events that have the potential to rock the market. Investors have been better buyers of protection over the last few sessions, and all eyes will be on the FOMC and then on the Scottish referendum.
"
"Credit Indices: The Odd Ones Out. Despite a fairly poor price action overnight in Asia and on Friday in the US, European risky assets were resilient across the board during the morning session. Ahead of a week packed with events that have the potential to impact markets, investors appear to stay on the side-lines. While this trend held on most markets once the US came in, credit indices begun their drift wider. iTraxx Main traded from 59.5 to 61bps and iTraxx Crossover traded from 244 to 251bps in a straight line. They closed 2.5bps and 9bps wider respectively. Single name CDSs are still impacted by the coming roll which will take place next Monday, and people are reluctant to buy contracts that will no longer be “on the run” in a week. The fair value of iTraxx Main closed only 1bp wider (dragged by the financial sector which actually accounted for almost 0.6bps). All this led to a widening of the European indices compared to their fair values.  The bases have widened steadily recently and they are approaching their recent wides. Something will have to give soon. If the FED manages investors’ expectations carefully, we will get a snap back on indices. If the Scots decide to go their own independent way, single names will go through a few torrid sessions.
"
"1 Piece of News, 2 Different Outcomes. It was a rather weak session for most of the day, until late headlines of potential easing by the PBOC and a WSJ article pointing to a dovish FOMC outcome tomorrow fueled an index rally to the closest round numbers (60 on iTraxx Main and CDX IG and 250 on iTraxx Crossover) which are incidently large pins for options  due to expire tomorrow. While single name protection felt well bid throughout the day across the board, the same rumours provided the out and underperformer in the Telco sector. An Italian paper reported that TITIM (  Telecom Italia Spa) would be studying an alliance with OI in Brazil. The immediate reaction was to send TITIM risk premium 12bps wider while PORTEL's (  Portugal Telecom SGPS SA) was 10bps tighter. But one can easily imagine scenarios where TITIM would make a right issue and any operation would need to pass the regulators' scrutiny in Brasil. Expect more volatility on these names going forward.

"News CDS Definitions Delayed. The market has been aware that new CDS definitions would be introduced during the September 2014 roll since early this year. The new definitions will take into account new credit events, and will allow the delivery of a wider range of securities into a CDS once a default happens. That will enable the CDS to behave very much like the bonds they are supposed to track, and will enable them to avoid a few technical pitfalls that affected them previously. CDS referencing banks will be particularly affected pricewise, while CDS referencing corporates and insurance companies will see their valuations hardly changed. The marketplace has therefore imagined a protocol that will migrate existing insurance and corporate CDS towards new definitions automatically, while existing banks’ CDS will remain under the current documentation. But the sign up to the protocol has been slower than expected, and some counterparties have proved reluctant to adhere as they wanted some (not many, only a handful in fact) corporate entities to be excluded from the automatic migration. All this haggling has eventually delayed the process, and the new definitions will only apply from the 6th October, rather than on the 22nd September. Existing indices will follow the protocol, and the new series will include the new definitions. It is therefore no surprise that the series 22 in Europe and Asia, and the series 23 in the US will only be issued on the 6th October. Ahead of the introduction of the new documentation, liquidity has been more challenging and volumes traded during the first week of September on single names were closer to what we see around Christmas than what we usually see when the market comes back from the summer holidays. Let’s hope there will not be any further delay.

"Has The Market Some Predictive Power?. Over the last couple of weeks, the uncertainty surrounding the referendum that will decide whether Scotland will chose independence has been very high. After a summer during which everyone took the result for granted, recent polls gave too close to call outcomes. But since the beginning of the week, investors have begun to show confidence again in a united Britain. The pound sterling has regained some ground against the Euro and the USD. In the credit market, the UK banks have seen their risk premium decrease. The same was true for the Spanish banks which suffered recently from potential contagion risk on the back of the momentum all claims for independence (and particularly from Catalonia) would gain in the case of a “Yes” victory. Even though access to the voting booths is still possible for another few hours, financial markets have already announced that Scotland will not severe the ties with the United Kingdom. We shall see tomorrow whether they are more reliable than the polling institutes.
"
"TUIGR Halves Its Issue Size. At the beginning of the week, TUIGR ( TUI AG) massively underperformed the market. During the week-end, they had reached an agreement on the terms of their merger with TUI Travel ( TUI Travel Plc), and they announced their intention to refinance a €600mln term loan by the issue of senior unsecured notes. The terms of the new issues were announce today. If the 5 year tranche came roughly as expected (not callable for 2 years and €300mln offered instead of the €250mln initially planned), the surprise came for the 7 year tranche that was simply cancelled. After having widened by 110bps from 211bps to 321bps between Monday and Wednesday, TUIGR’s 5 year risk premium was back to 280bps on the back of this issue downsize. That made TUIGR one of the outperformers of the day, and investors were able to pocket 1.5pt as the new issue traded above the issue price straight after the break, but it pales in comparison of the astonishing 30% day 1 performance of the Alibaba IPO.
"
"Big day, first day for the new ISDA 2014. Today we hadthe first CDS trading session with the new ISDA 2014 definitions. The main impact is a much improved adequacy of the CDS to hedge the sovereign's and the bank's risks. The market impact on financial senior CDS is limited but it is much more important on the subordinated CDS. Except this impact, the roll was a bull roll especially in Europe. The CDS widening is due to the maturity extension along the CDS curve, but only half of the extension has been reflected in the market prices.


"
"China Is Back On The Radar. During the summer, all the materials and commodities related credits have experienced of a very good run. Most of them belong to the high beta category, and they benefitted from the compression that was obvious in most markets. Higher yielding assets have outperformed across the board. But it looks as if people are being a bit more selective recently. Now that central banks have made their decisions regarding QE clearer and that the Scottish referendum is behind us, investors can focus once again on other themes. One which has been popular over the last sessions is the future path of the Chinese economy and the sustainability of its growth going forward. To play a potential slow down, the traditional names being targeted are miners and commodity related corporates. Investors have not waited long after the roll, and, in a generally weak trading session, the risk premium of these have been put under severe pressure, with MTNA, GLEINT, AALLN and TKAGR closing 14bps, 12.5bps, 10.5bps and 6.5bps wider respectively. 
"
"Fraud Is Still The Biggest Risk. Over the last few sessions, consumers have been under pressure amid signs of a stagnant Eurozone economy. Most of them are high beta, and they also suffered from the renewed interest regarding the decompression theme. That was particularly true for UK retailers, which were impacted yesterday by the closely watched data from Kantar Worldpanel which shown that discounters are still gaining market shares. But the main driver was definitely the restatement by TSCOLN ( Tesco Plc) of their 1H earnings on Monday. They identified accounting issues relating to supplier rebates, the effect of which was to overstate 1H guidance for trading profits by an estimated £250mln. No explanation was given at the time regarding the reason of this profit warning, and the sanction was instantaneous and brutal. Credit investors know that fraud is their biggest risk, and the Banco Espirito debacle is fresh in everybody’s mind. Whenever the “F” word is mentioned, you can expect a torrid time for the corporate in question.
"
"VIX Is Not The Only Fear Gauge. What begun as lacklustre session ended in pretty hectic trading, at least on credit indices. As some investors are away for Rosh Hashanah, most expected a quiet day and it certainly started that way. But when the US came in, some large lifts of protection took place as the high yield cash continues to trade very poorly. From 1pm, risk premia started to widen and never looked back. ITraxx Crossover (ITXEX521), which already underperformed other European credit indices yesterday, bore the brunt of the pain and widened much more than its usual beta would have predicted. When things are going wild, trading is concentrated on the most liquid instruments. Unsurprisingly, single names were more chilled and did not experience that bad a day. That will change tomorrow if the mood stays gloomy though. But in the meantime, iTraxx Crossover traded further away from its value and its basis (BTXEX21) spike to 65cts. A value above 75cts is typical of a market under serious stress. We are not there yet, but the credit fear gauge is heating up.
"
"How Big Is Pimco?. It was a fairly quiet day in most asset classes today. Most but certainly not all. Every asset that Pimco is supposed to own actually took a beating. Credit indices, and particularly CDX IG, experienced a particularly difficult session. It was impacted in 2 different ways. Pimco is rumoured to have sold big chunks of protection on this index, and they are also supposed to own very large amounts of corporate bonds. If investors were to pull out money from their funds in the wake of Bill Gross’ departure, Pimco would have to buy these indices back which would certainly push them wider. They would also have to sell bonds, and other people also owning these securities could suffer. So buying credit indices is definitely one of the hedging possibilities at their disposal, which probably brought a few more buyers of credit indices. This also pushed CDX IG wider. No one knows what Pimco will do or if investors will pull their money, but the mere size of the potential rebalancing was enough to scare the hell out of the market.
"
"Concerns Over Valuations, Not Default. Since the September roll, the credit market has somewhat been repriced and 5 year risk premia are wider across the board. Indeed, we can see that all the pin heads are pointing to the right. There had been all sorts of worries for some time (from geopolitical risks to the pace of the worldwide economic recovery), and the catalyst for them to translate into some negative price action was the news that Bill Gross changed ship and the redemptions it could trigger at Pimco. With that in mind, it is not surprising that curves have steepened since last Monday. The market is not predicting an acceleration of the defaults in the near future (nor does it predict such thing in the medium term actually). This would have triggered a bear flattening of the short end, raising the cost of insurance for short dated maturities. The market is just anticipating a tough few weeks/months ahead as money could be reallocated at the expense of what is currently one of the biggest credit portfolios. 

"
"One Day Does Not Tell The Whole Story. Risky assets decided to close the month on a positive note, and credit was no exception. All indices closed tighter on the day, caught in a wave of short covering. But that does not tell the story of the month. Since investors came back from holidays, the credit component of their portfolio has not fared well. Everything is wider on both side of the Atlantic, from investment grade to high yield. Decompression was quite obvious, as expected in a bearish environment, and iTraxx Crossover underperformed iTraxx Main on a beta adjusted basis, while CDX HY underperformed CDX IG. The other salient fact is the underperformance of US indices compared with their European counterparts. CDX HY has trended wider than iTraxx Crossover all year long, and is now trading 100bps wider. This is a further sign of decompression, as there are very few distressed names in iTraxx Crossover as opposed to CDX HY which includes the likes Radioshack (RSH), Sears (SHLD), Caesars (HET) and Toys R us (TOY) to name a few. The gap will be much narrower with the next series of indices as iTraxx Crossover S22 will be expanded into real high yield territory. In September, CDX IG also underperformed massively iTraxx Main. The former does not have the support of Pimco at the moment, while the latter benefits from the support of the ECB.
"
"CSC Is Marketing Itself... Again. Recently most of the moves in credit have been driven by macro factors (linked with geopolitics, central banks or fund flows) and individual moves were few and far between. There was a lot of beta, and hardly any alpha. In that respect, CSC was the odd one out. The company was reported to have contacted private equity firms regarding the prospect of an LBO. CSC's business is currently split between GBS (which focuses on consulting and software solutions to businesses), GIS (which has data centers, cloud and security offerings), and NPS (which provides a combination of services specific to government customers). It seems that all possible combinations of splits and sales to PE and/or to strategic suitors are being considered, which makes it unclear whether an LBO will effectively take place. But CSC has already been the subject of break-up rumours and the management of the company seems to have been dressing it up for a buyout with divestments (such as the sale of its credit service business to Equifax 2 years ago). So investors did not take any chance, and they sent CSC's risk premium a good 70bps wider since the beginning of the week.
"
"Defiance Towards iTraxx Crossover S21. Over the last week or so, we have seen some compression in indices, especially between iTraxx Main (ITXEB) and iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX). That is what one would expect during moves wider, but not really during moves wider. We had both recently, and in almost all cases ITXEX outperformed ITXEB on a beta adjusted basis. During the last 5 trading sessions, ITXEB widened 3.5bps compared with a 7bps widening of ITXEX. What is the most striking is the basis between these indices and their theoretical values. On ITXEB, it stands at 20cts, which is typical of a defensive investors’ mood. But on ITXEX, it stands at 10cts, when one would expect a reading comfortably above 50cts during a day where equities lost in the region of 2%. It seems that investors’ positioning has been fairly defensive throughout the summer, and that they think ITXEX will no longer do a good job at protecting their portfolio in its current form. They are selling the protection on series 21 they bought earlier in the year, and are waiting to reposition themselves on series 22. The new series that will start trading next Monday will certainly be closer to their portfolio as it will include more high yield names and will be more diversified, but it is always a risky game to leg your roll.
"
"Index Velocity. Next Monday, the new credit index series will start to trade, series 22 in Europe and series 23 in the US, both having a December 2019 for the 5 year standard contract. The “credit index roll” combined with a positive session for all risky assets has put a strong selling pressure on the credit indices protections. The iTraxx Crossover which is the most favourite credit index to hedge the European high yield credit was on sale. It has tighten by 20bps from 265bps to 245bps, twice as fast as the CDS underlying entities. We have a very special situation where the Crossover index is trading inside its fair value while still being on-the-run. This technical should remain the next sessions while investors keep rolling their hedges into the new series. Index velocity has been at play for all credit indices from Europe to US, with the iTraxx Crossover credit index and the CDX HY credit index being the best runners.
"
"A new Vintage for the Credit Indices . The market started to trade Series 22 in Europe and Series 23 in the US. The trading pattern was atypical especially for the iTraxx Crossover index. The new iTraxx Crossover index contains 75 names with 20 new entrants having spreads trading above 500bps, single B corporate for most of them. The new index is a better proxy for hedging high yield portfolios but also a nice product yielding a 3.40% running spread with a diversified set of risks. Due to this new composition, investors started to sell protection all day long. This is the first time in many rolls that the Crossover roll is trading inside its fair value at its first close, while the off-the-run indices are trading much wider like the Series 21.  There is some price discovery to be realized on the new entrants that have little traded in CDS so far before to have a definitive conclusion on the atypical start of this new vintage. But, for today, on the graph, we can observe that all the Crossover basis are closing up while the on-the-run basis is closing at -34cts, the index trading tighter than its fair value.
"
"Is it Just Consolidation?. After the bullish price action we have seen over the last week or so with some relentless tightening affecting both single name CDS and credit indices, the tone seemed to have changed today, especially in the high yield space. The reporting season will begin tomorrow, and investors needed to take a breather. A number of bonds were better offered, and that fed through the CDS market, where single name protection was bid up throughout the day. That demand for protection was met by a steady stream of iTraxx Crossover index selling (it is optically yielding more than it has ever done this year on the back of the reshuffling of its constituents on Monday), which balanced out the flows thanks to index replication strategies. So far it only looks like a sound consolidation, but on Friday Matalan will report their results which many reckon could set the tone for the single B space. 
"
"A new Pattern on Credit Index Basis? . Since the emission of the new indices last Monday, a new pattern has emerged. The credit indices are trading tight to their fair value. The index trading levels are tighter than the average of their single names members.  This is rather unusual as the indices are rather used for hedging purpose and the flows are imbalanced with more buyers than sellers of protection. This roll is different. All the basis have collapsed, with the iTraxx Crossover very negative into this close. As per the graph, even the investment grade on-the-run credit index basis have collapsed with the CDX Investment Grade trading 6bps below its fair value (-30cts), close to 10% of the spread. The current trading level of the index is around 68. Tomorrow, the CDX High Yield index is expected to be launched. This index is still trading cheap to its fair value. We are interested in observing if the new pattern affect this index or if the recent trading activity has produced a rather unusual market configuration and we will go back to the index usual behaviour shortly.
"
"Healthy Dispersion. Credit markets have been busy today. The unusually stretched index valuations compared to their fair values (almost all indices are trading rich, i.e. their risk premia are wider than what single names are saying) has led to numerous trades during the session across a very wide spectrum of reference entities. That means that risk has changed hands on almost every name, which is a healthy situation. This has led to some repricing on names that had been stale for a while. On the back of that, even though the daily variations are fairly small on indices, the dispersion on single names was very important.
"
"Is Decompression There To Stay?. Generally speaking credit has been very resilient recently  in the face of equity weakness. While the S&P; is down 3% since the beginning of the week and the Eurostoxx down 4%, CDX IG S23 and iTraxx Main S22 are only 1bp wider since their launch, i.e. over the same period. But today for the first time, the higher yielding names were notably more impacted than the rest of the credit market. iTraxx Financial Sub underperformed iTraxx Financial Senior, and iTraxx Crossover underperformed iTraxx Main. Decompression is a theme that has been advocated by many in a more uncertain environment. We shall see whether it is there to persist, as Crossover Tranches will soon be introduced by the dealer community on the series 22, which offers a diversified and rather yieldy portfolio. That could attract investors as it will provide them with a leveraged investment and could put a cap on the iTraxx Crossover index risk premium.
"
"Is Ebola Affecting Credit?. Most of the US markets were closed for Columbus Day, and activity was less frantic during today’s session that it was last week. That was the opportunity for the market to give some thoughts to recent events. With new cases of Ebola in continental Europe and in the US gaining more press coverage, investors were bound to assess which businesses could be most impacted. Unsurprisingly, they first focused on the travel industry. Names like BAB (British Airways Plc), TUIGR ( TUI AG), SOLSM ( Melia Hotels International SA) were all weaker and contributed to the underperformance of the Consumer Cyclicals. The losers are obvious for all to see, but everyone is still looking for who could come up with a solution.
"
"ITXES21 Basis, New Docs And The AQR. Because they feared CDS written using the 2003 documentation would become illiquid past the September roll, investors have favoured hedging the financial part of their portfolio with indices rather than single name CDS since the beginning of the summer. While activity on single names had slowed quite a bit up to September, the iTraxx Senior Financial index (the series 21, on the run at the time) was consistently bid. That led to a chronically positive basis between the index and its fair value. In other words the index risk premium was wider than its theoretical value based on the risk premia of its constituents. Now, the AQR results are in sight (they should be released in a few weeks) and the rumour has it that most banks will pass, and in any case all the tier one institutions will come unscathed. So investors have started to unwind their long protection positions on index series 21, leading to a correction of the basis over the last 10 days. That trend appears set to continue. Future protection purchases will take place on the series 22 which is cleaner in terms of documentation (all its constituents trade on 2014 docs, while banks in the series21 still trade on 2003 docs) and buyers of protection on the series 21 will be few and far between. 
"
"Everybody Out Of The Pool!. After a fairly uneventful morning, equities started to move aggressively down during the afternoon session. As stocks fell off a cliff and govies went moonwards, credit saw all available bids being hit on cash bonds and investors were not shy of crossing bid offers to buy protection on unwanted residual long risk positions. There was no real panic though (except for a 30 minutes spell when Barcelona Airport was rumoured to be quarantined following confirmed cases of ebola virus, a rumour that was never confirmed), and some people even saw that widening of risk premia as an opportunity to reload risk on good quality credits. That led to another round of decompression in Europe, exacerbated in Europe by the discrepancy in the initial basis to theoretical levels of iTraxx Main and iTraxx Crossover. Important technical and psychological levels have been breached on many risky assets, so bottom fishing seems a dangerous game to play at this stage. If a proper derisking period begins, higher beta names are still the most at risk, and decompression should have more legs from here. 
"
"Tout Ça Pour Ça?. Today’s session was reminiscent of the wild swings the market experienced back at the pick of the sovereign crisis. It was characterised by fear much more than greed, and at some stage some indices were left without any offer of protection. It is difficult to point to a specific catalyst. It was a combination of the recessive effects of a potential worldwide ebola outbreak, of the European excessive debt burden coming back to haunt Greece, France, Italy and Spain, and of the draining of the unlimited liquidity made available to the market at the moment by central banks. From an initial unchanged open, European indices saw their risk premia widened by 10% during the morning. Snap backs tighter were numerous and vicious, but only led to more widening. It took some dovish declarations by Fed officials to calm the market which eventually closed only marginally tighter. Someone casually looking at the daily variations would be forgiven for thinking it was a benign session, but that would be missing the huge total daily variations (30bps in total on iTraxx Main and close to 120b on iTraxx Crossover).
"
"Are We Back On The Rally Train?. If you looked at the same Grapple yesterday, it was red hot. Today it is a sea of green as we were back on the rally train. Everyone happily forgot the last two days and sold away all their hedges. Indices, which were impossible to buy when iTraxx Crossover was trading at 430bps 24 hours ago, were offered since the word “go” in the morning. The move tighter from 400bps to 375bps on iTraxx Crossover and from 77bps to 71.5 on iTraxx Main was made in a straight line. That inevitably fed through the single name market and most reference entities were marked tighter across the board. It required a very good reason for a risk premium to widen. AMD’s results were one of them. They announced Q4 revenues down 13% q/q and said they plan to cut 7% of their workforce. It is a lonely red spot though.
"
"Accor: On Its Way To 200bps?. Last week, ACCOR ( Accor SA ) was rumoured to have submitted a non-binding offer for Starwood’s Louvre hotels. The latter is a European budget hotel chain. It could be worth somewhere between €1.2bln and €1.5bln. Analysts reckon this acquisition would fit ACCOR’s strategy and would represent an interesting use of the cash they are currently sitting on. But for credit holders, there is a glitch. ACCOR is currently rated at the lowest investment grade level and have very limited headroom under the company’s current BBB- rating category. In all likelihood, unless they go down the route of a massive right issue, they will be downgraded to junk if they end up buying Louvre. In iTraxx Crossover, TUIGR ( TUI AG) is trading at 330bps and SOLSM ( Melia Hotels International SA) at 425bps. Accor has more hard assets than TUIGR and a better balance sheet than SOLSM, so in any case it would probably not trade that wide, but a risk premium in the 200/250bps region is a distinct possibility. ACCOR’s 5 year CDS has already reacted to the news, but, with spreads between BBB- and BB at multi year highs, it will continue its march wider if the acquisition of Louvre is confirmed.
"
"Why Fix It If It’s Not Broken?. Today risky assets stabilised after the remarkable turnaround which took place over the last few sessions. Since central bankers started to speak last week, all indices have seen their risk premia decrease by roughly 20% across the board. After the ECB was said to consider bringing corporate bonds purchase to the agenda of their December meeting, the rally monkey was out in full force yesterday. Even though ECB sources later said that preparations for buying debt had not intensified recently, there was no outright denial either, which explains why the credit market (like most other markets) has been in no hurry to pare back its recent gains. Credit indices have not completely put behind them the early October mini drama though. European debt problems are now back in people’s mind, and iTraxx Main is now trading a couple of basis points wider that CDX IG when it was trading a couple of basis points tighter at the end of September.
"
"Will Tesco Be In iTraxx Crossover 23?. TESCO’s ( Tesco Plc ) miserable second half of 2014 continued today. Accounting issues surfaced in September and drove its 5 year risk premium from 90bps to 140bps. During a conference call today, investors learned that these irregularities had been going on for more than 6 months, that their impact was larger than initially thought (not by much, but still… ) and that they had adversely impacted the task of rejuvenating the company. They were also told that first-half earnings plunged 41% amid slumping sales both at home and internationally, and little detail were provided on the CEO’s strategic plan for a turnaround. The resignation of the chairman did little to calm the market, and the shares lost 6.5% in London, while the 5 year CDS was pushed back to its widest levels. The latter was not helped by the fact that both Fitch and Moody’s downgraded the company to BBB- and kept their outlook negative. Cash holders will now be worried about a potential junk status, and, if the 5 year risk premium were to stay at current levels, TSCO could leave iTraxx Main to join iTraxx Crossover next March.
"
"What To Do With The AQR Results?. In Europe, trading slowed a little bit today after what has been a hectic week which saw risk premia going from the widest levels since April to almost the tightest levels of the year (iTraxx Main S21 is trading at 58bps). Credit spreads stabilised with a small consolidation bias. The underperformance of Consumer Non-Cyclical still came from UK retailers, where the TSCO’s ( Tesco Plc ) saga is still unfolding and the name another 27bps wider. The financial sector, and more specifically banks, proved the most challenging for investors. They seemed unable to decide what to make of the leaks which inevitably occurred during the session regarding the AQR results. On the one hand failure of more than just a few banks shows that the regulator is getting serious about the exercise and is a positive. That brought a few offers of single name protection to the market. On the other hand, failure of more than just a few institutions is not exactly great news. That provided a bid to iTraxx Financial indices.
"
"iTraxx Crossover Basis Normalisation. The new series of indices were launched on the 6th October. For most of the month, the basis of the new series of iTraxx Crossover was more negative than any other series. iTraxx Crossover S23 was the cheapest available index of the family compared to its fair value if you wanted to buy protection. It was a fairly unusual situation as the iTraxx Crossover on-the-run series is normally the instrument of choice to hedge high yield portfolios. Investors favour the most liquid index when they want to get through periods of uncertainty. The recent patch of volatility has been enough to correct that abnormality though. The series 23 has gradually regained its natural position and is now the most expensive (but the most liquid, and that comes at a price) hedging tool. At the same time, the basis has gone out of negative territory and now buying protection via the index is more expensive than buying protection on each of its constituents. The recent increase in nervousness among investors allowed the standard market pattern to be restored. 
"
"Vimpelcom/Hutchison: A Deal Is Done… Not. As a whole, the credit market has been relatively well behaved since the beginning of the week. There was some intraday volatility, but nothing compared to what we have seen last week. A few names have been all over the place though, and the most striking example is WINDIM. Yesterday, its 5 year risk premium was 25bps tighter @ 425bps as press articles surfaced suggesting that Vimpelcom was weighting merging their Italian assets with Hutchison on the back of comments made by the CFO last week. Investors do not appear to tire of this story which has been going on for more than a year, and they sold protection aggressively. Subsequently Vimpelcom issued a statement saying that they were discussing with Hutchison “the potential value which would accrue to shareholders through a 50/50 joint venture in Italy” and that “no conclusion to these discussions was reached”. Basically, there was in fact nothing new. That did not go down very well with the market which today decided to interpret this as a failure acknowledgement. The 5 year risk premium went all the way back and more, widening 40bps to 466bps.
"
"FIAT Announced Ferrari’s IPO. The reporting season is in full on both side of the Atlantic, and it has been a fairly positive one so far. The beat/miss ratio compared with analysts’ expectations looks favourably compared to historical standards, but most of the results releases have been considered as non-events, and they generally failed to move the market one way or the other. A few names stood out though, and were subject to a burst of volatility. Take FIAT for instance. Their earnings today were a non-event as they reiterated their guidance, however they also announced that they are planning to spin off 90% of Ferrari. They will IPO 10% of the company and distribute the remaining 80% to (Fiat Chrysler Automobiles shareholders. When the headlines hit the tape the 5 year risk premium traded aggressively tighter, down 25bps. But when the full story emerged, investors were quick to bid it up, as it essentially looks like they are giving the family jewels away to shareholders. The 5 year CDS eventually closed only 9bps tighter.
"
"Are 3 Year Risk Premia Too Cheap?. One would expect the risk premium curve of a company to be closely related to its debt profile. In reality, as you can see on this grapple, as long as the 5 year risk premium is below 500, the 3 year risk premium dispersion is very low. The 3 year risk premium is roughly a linear function of the 5 year risk premium. One can argue that, for companies whose 5 year risk premium is trading below 500bps, the actual default risk is fairly remote, which would justify this one size fits all pattern. In such an environment, one would then expect the risk premia to increase in a linear fashion up to 5 year, and the 3 year risk premium should be worth 3/5 of the 5 year risk premium. But if you look closely at this grapple, you will see that it is only worth 1/2 of it. Once again that can be explained by saying that given the near zero interest rate environment, no one will default soon and that there is no point is paying premium for short dated protection. That is good news for investors who are less sanguine about the future. They have the opportunity to buy 3 year protection which has a very limited roll down (most of it takes place between the 5 year and 3 year points) and which will have the same dynamics as the 5 year if the market widens. Their only real downside is a more speculative liquidity.
"
"The AQR, One Week On. A total of €25bln capital shortfall across 25 participant banks was jointly identified by the AQR and the stress tests last week. It appeared to strike the right balance, strict enough to show the ECB means business when it comes to the safety of the financial system but without too many casualties (and also a good part of the mending job already done as a portion of the shortfall has already been raised in the market since the beginning of the year) not to spook the market. The initial reaction of investors was very positive indeed, but most of it was gone in the first hours of trading on Monday. During the whole week, financials actually failed to outperform the market and it looked as a typical example of the “buy the rumour, sell the fact” adage. There was a persistent bid for protection on banks, both in 2014 and 2003 docs, which probably means that old long risk positions were unwound. While the credit market traded sideways, financials were the clear underperformers on the back of profit taking.
"
"Increased Dispersion. During the month of October, the credit market has experienced some wild swings. A leg wider mid-October, as questions were asked regarding the strength of the recovery, followed by a central banks inspired rally left risk premia almost unchanged on average, both in investment grade and high yield. But that masks some sector divergence and an increase dispersion, which is best evidenced by the persistently negative basis (i.e. the risk premium paid on an index is less than the sum of the risk premia paid on its constituents) for both iTraxx Main in Europe and CDX IG in the US. While you can see on this grapple representing US investment grade credits that the moves have been somewhat wilder over the last 4 weeks than they were since the beginning of the year, you can also see that the energy sector has massively underperformed all the others. It is the only subset of the CDX IG which closed the month of October wider, despite a 50% widening of its risk premium in September already. In little more than 8 weeks, the average 5 year CDS spread of the energy sector in the US has gone from 76bps to 126bps. The equivalent grapple in Europe paints a similar picture, showing that a 15% drop in crude prices has not gone unnoticed in creditland.

"Is Decompression Down To The ECB?. There are plenty of macroeconomic data this week. Today we had PMIs across Europe which were a mixed bag. The political backdrop in Europe keeps deteriorating, with recent polls showing Podemos leading intentions in Spain for instance. And worrying noise is coming out of Ukraine once more. But all that will only eventually become relevant after Thursday when the ECB meeting is taking place. Investors think that recent developments regarding (the absence of) inflation and potential de-anchoring of market expectations will force Mr Draghi to a more accommodative stance despite German opposition. Most assume that it will eventually lead to corporate bond purchases and they are putting their money at work accordingly. As such purchases will revolve around investment grade companies, it is therefore not surprising that decompression has been a major theme over the last few sessions. Whatever the general direction of the market move, iTraxx Crossover has systematically underperformed iTraxx Main during last week.

"Will Apax Spoils Altice's Party. ALTICE (Altice SA) provided the market with a bit of action during an otherwise fairly lacklustre day in credit compared with equity. Indeed Apax reportedly decided to enter the fray regarding Oi SA’s assets in Portugal. That means that Portel might not be bagged by Altice, which offered €6.2bln and two €0.4bln performance driven earn-outs for the company. Accordingly, investors moved ALTICE’s 5 year risk premium 25bps tighter in early trading. But for Apax and its co bidders (CVC and Bain Capital) to succeed, they would have to overbid ALTICE, as it is not obvious on which grounds the Portuguese government (which in fact does not hold a golden share) would favour a PE consortium. During the rest of the day, people were left to ponder the pros and cons on both solutions (ALTICE will argue they will invest and save jobs in Potugal, while Apax et al will benefit from a significantly faster regulatory process), and the ALTICE’s 5 year CDS eventually closed 12bps tighter at 450bps.
"
"More Dispersion. In the recent past, some sectors have been put under severe pressure, in Europe and in the US. The pain felt a bit more acute in the US where the consumer retail and the energy sectors have provided some notable under-performers. Today the dispersion increased some more, when GNW (Genworth Financial Inc) tumbled after announcing a record loss. Its stock fell more than 35% and its 5 year risk premium doubled, reaching 315bps. The third quarter results painted a grim picture about its long-term care business, and the CEO declared that ""the turnaround in this business will be more difficult and prolonged"". The credibility of the management appears seriously damaged and investors punished the company. It is no wonder then that the basis of the CDX IG (the difference between the quoted value of the index and the theoretical value derived from the levels of its individual constituents) has been consistently negative (i.e. the risk premium of the index is tighter than its theoretical value) recently. Investors who want long risk exposure keep selling CDX IG (a diversified portfolio which trades in big size with tight bid/offer spreads) and fight at the same time to buy CDS on the riskier names.
"
"Alpha Is Back… In The US At Least. The general credit market traded sideways today. In Europe, iTraxx Main and iTraxx Corssover saw their theoretical hardly move. Their quoted prices were a bit more volatile during the session, but their daily variations were minimal (+1bp for Main at 64.5bps and +2.5bps for Crossover at 352.5bps). But it was a different story in the US, even if indices felt quite sticky around their current levels (66bps for CDX IG and 345bps for CDX HY). All the bright spots in this grapple showing the intensity of the daily moves come from American companies (except STENA which moved in sympathy with RIG). Results announcements eventually seem to impact CDS trajectories. GNW (Genworth Holdings, Inc) continued its torrid ride in the wake of its announced $844mln loss and saw its 5 year risk premium widened another 90bps to 405bps. It is now one of the 3 names trading above 400bps, with RIG (Transocean Inc) which also widened today by 40bps to 425bps after delaying its 3rd quarter earnings release (the company will take impairment charges of $2.76bln) and AVP (Avon Products Inc). The monolines were also on the move, and widened following MBIA shareholders friendly action (they will buyback $200m stocks). The outperformers were mainly commodity related companies retracing part of their recent aggressive move wider. 
"
"Rating Still Matters (Sometimes). The session turned out to be fairly strong across the board, and there were only a handful of names which closed wider on the day. The tone was a bit more hesitant in the morning though, as people feared that the bank holiday in the US tomorrow would weight on liquidity. In the early hours of trading, RENAUL ( Renault SA ) was one of the standout names. It started the day strongly on the back of an upgrade by Fitch. The rating agency revised RENAUL’s rating to BBB- outlook positive, bringing it back in the investment grade category. The 5 year CDS quickly tightened by 15bps (it closed at 112.5bps) as buyers of cash started to emerge. Indeed, if this upgrade took place earlier that investors had anticipated, they now expect S&P; and Moodys to follow suit. If that happens, investment grade funds will start to buy cash, which should lead to further outperformance. Rating actions still matter, especially for names that sit on the border of investment grade and high yield. 
"
"Is CDX IG On Top Of ITraxx Main For Good. CDX IG in the US and iTraxx Main in Europe are usually going hands in hands. Thanks to the normalisation in Europe of the financials on the back of Mr Draghi’s now famous “whatever it takes”, the spread between the 2 has not been more than 10bps over the last year. Still, CDX IG was trading inside iTraxx Main, and it is only since September that this relationship broke. With the comfort investors got from the AQR results in Europe, and the recent underperformance of energy and consumers names which was more acute in the US, the fair value of CDX IG (as derived from the prices of its individual constituents) now stands 5bps on top of the fair value of iTraxx Main. The indices are still very close, but one could expect the same to happen with them. iTraxx Main could fairly soon trade tighter than CDX IG, which is the situation which used to prevail until 2010 when hell broke loose in European sovereigns (you can see that if you increase the time span to Max in the top left corner of the grapple).
"
"Guess Which Series Has The New Docs?. Historically the iTraxx Financial Subordinated index family has been fairly heterogeneous because of the coupon discrepancies between series and because of composition discrepancies from one index vintage to the other, which matter all the more when there are only 25 constituents. Nevertheless, all series up to the series 21 have currently one feature in common, they are all expensive compared to their fair value (their risk premium is tighter than the theoretical value computed with their constituents’ risk premia) while iTraxx Financial Sub S22 is cheap. That can be explained by the difference in documentations. Series 22 is fully compliant with the 2014 documentation which includes additional credit events making CDS’ behaviour closer to what takes place in cash, while the previous series are not. Hence, investors have switched their hedges to the current series to take advantage of this new feature, creating in imbalance between on and off the run indices.
"
"The Devil Is In The Details. Yesterday ABGSM ( Abengoa SA ) published quarterly results which were at first glance broadly in line with what people were expecting. Hence dealers opened the name unchanged. But when investors begun to comb the reports, they realised that the company had tweaked somewhat their reported leverage which stood at 2.1x. Indeed it includes €250mln proceeds from a disposal which are yet to be collected and it excludes €500mln of ABG Greenfields bonds which the company considers to be non-recourse despite their guarantee by ABGSM. That put ABGSM right into the spotlight and their bonds were indicated 6 to 7 points lower while the 5 year risk premium traded skywards, up 250bps to roughly 1000bps (in fact 16 points upfront plus 500bps running). That only adds to the recent increase in dispersion, which has translated into an unusually negative basis for the on the run series of iTraxx Crossover.
"
"Decompression: The Theme Into Year End ?. Yesterday, questions begun to be asked regarding ABGSM’s ( Abengoa SA ) approach of leverage and the name was under serious pressure. But that was nothing compared to today, as investors continued to put the company’s reporting under the microscope and doubled its risk premium from already elevated levels. The suspicion spread to other names in the iTraxx Crossover, and people obviously revisited a few long risk positions that were taken a bit lightly, essentially on the back of attractive risk premia but without a thorough credit examination. Most of the newcomers in the series 22, which are genuine high yield names and offer the best remuneration, were indicated wider. That pushed the fair value of iTraxx Crossover 10bps. The index itself “only” widened 6bps, but it could keep its march higher next week. At the same time, iTraxx Main was unchanged on the day. It still benefits from its safe haven status and from the good vibes coming from the US, where CDX IG seems unmovable. Together with dispersion, decompression could be a major theme into the end of the year.
"
"HY Is No Not For The Faint Hearted. In the afternoon, Mr Draghi was reported to have said the ECB purchase program could include government bonds. A little squeeze followed in credit, with indices moving back to unchanged on the day after a somewhat weak morning. It seems that European QE is taking shape and could happen in the not too distant future. Investors appear convinced that sovereigns and investment grade corporates will be targeted. That means their yields will continue to be depressed and people will be cornered into investing in higher yielding names. They should be careful though. If today the high yield compartment as a whole was tighter, the dispersion was massive. For instance, in CDS, ABGSM and ASTIM were an impressive 384bps and 58bps tighter respectively while UNILSUB and OTE were 44bps and 13bps wider respectively. The same was true for names which are not yet (or not much) traded in CDS but have cash bonds: Manutencoop bonds dropped 15points following disappointing results and Boparan bonds tumbled 5pts after a bird flu case was confirmed on a duck farm in Yorkshire. Investing in High Yield can be very rewarding, but you need to choose wisely.
"
"Dispersion Is Still Very High. Today was marked by the underperformance of credit compared with equities. While stocks enjoyed a positive session (Eurostoxx up almost 1.5%), credit indices closed wider across the board, even though their fair values was marginally tighter in Europe. But once again, the most striking feature was the dispersion among the names in the high yield universe. After its horrid widening last week, ABGSM  ( Abengoa SA ) snapped back most of its loss after the management clarify their cash position and reassured the market regarding their relationships with their bankers during a conference call yesterday and begun a round of investors’ meeting today. ASTIM ( Astaldi Spa ), BRIPL (Brisa) and BNSIM ( Beni Stabili ) which suffered previously from ABGSM’s woes, also tightened in sympathy. UNILSUB (Unilabs Subholding AB) first opened under pressure (the 5 year risk premium was up 4 points at some stage in the morning) ahead of their results, before eventually posting better than expected numbers and closed 30bps tighter. At the other end of the spectrum, STENA saw its risk premium increased 10bps after its CEO commented on the weaker outlook and recovery post cutting 1000 jobs. OTE ( Hellenic Telecommunications Organisation SA ) kept suffering from dealers bad positioning and also widened 30bps on the back on these technicals.
"
"Credit Won't Go Tighter. Over the last few sessions, credit has underperformed equities, and iTraxx Crossover has underperformed iTraxx Main. It should not necessarily come as a surprise. First the new issue calendar has been hectic recently and near record amount of bonds have been brought to the market. That usually leads to hedging activity which is naturally conducted using credit indices. Secondly, the market has experienced a number of idiosyncratic events since the beginning of the month that gave investors food for thoughts. Today alone, Towergate’s bonds lost 15pts after negative results and Obrascom’s lost 5pts after the company’s downgrade by Moody’s to B1 with a negative outlook. Before that we had Manutencoop and Boparan on Monday which suffered respectively from negative results and bird flu scare, while last week  Abengoa was all over the place. In that context, reducing exposure can make sense and investors were net buyers of iTraxx Crossover S22 (which include the most high yield names of all series) protection last week, as shown by the DTCC numbers published earlier today.
"
"Crossover Rolls Are Marching Steeper. Much has been said recently about decompression. On the one hand, higher quality names are well behaved and their risk premia are tight by most standards. One exception today though was Technip which saw its 5 year CDS widened by 20bps following their €1.47bln bid for Compagnie Generale de Geophysique (CGG), which proves that investment grade corporates are not immune from headline risk. On the other hand, the most leveraged companies have undergone some serious examination recently and the market has punished every misstep. Almost every day there are a handful of names which see their bonds battered. Today’s losers were Towergate, Hema, Bormioli and Loxam to name a few (losing respectively 10pts, 5pts, 5pts and 3pts), while for once CGG provided a rare bright spot (bonds up 12pts). It has naturally translated into an underperformance of iTraxx Crossover compared with iTraxx Main in Europe over the last week (and the same happened in the US where CDX HY underperformed CDX IG), but it has also led to a substantial steepening of the rolls between the iTraxx Crossover S22 and all the off the run series. Indeed, iTraxx Crossover S22 is the index which include the most genuine high yield companies, which was a direct effect of the expansion of the basket from 50 to 60 and then 75 names. For instance, the S21/S22 roll has traded up from 117bps last Thursday to 129 at the close of business today.
"
"Tight Spreads And Negative Bases?. You can forget all that has been said and written over the last week! No more weakness, no more decompression. Today, risk premia of credit indices tightened almost in a straight line from the word “go”. The snap back was triggered by the announcement of China easing, but it really started to get legs once Mr Draghi didactically explained the benefits of a broader asset purchase program during a speech delivered to a crowd of German bankers, after saying that the ECB has reached the lower bound on interest rates. The rally monkey was out of the bag and indices (once you factor in the effect of the rolls) effectively traded at their tightest levels of the year. Unsurprisingly in such a violent move, indices have moved further than single names and bases to theoretical values are deeply negative, particularly in iTraxx Crossover. People have been questioning how such a situation can persist in a lower spread environment. But the last few weeks have shown that dispersion is back with a vengeance and will probably not go away (not just yet anyway) on the back of central bankers’ speech, irrespective of how determined to act they can sound. That is the real driver of bases.
"
"Cash vs CDS: Hedged And Wedged?. Today credit indices kept their march tighter. iTraxx Crossover, iTraxx Main, CDX IG and CDX HY were 9bps, 2.75bps, 1.5bps and 7bps tighter respectively. Because bases to theoretical values were already stretched at the beginning of the session, offers of protection rapidly built up on single names and most finished the day meaningfully tighter (2bps on average in investment grade and 10bps in crossover/high yield). At the same time, cash bonds’ momentum is somewhat stalling. If prices were holding up, they did not keep up with pace of CDS. That can be explained by recent outflows, particularly among high yield funds, and also the amount of new issues which were brought to the market over the last few weeks. As usual, this will put a few people in an uncomfortable position, particularly dealers who hedge exposures they deem too large on cash using CDS. 
"
"An Opportunistic Move. Even though the momentum appears to slow a little bit in the CDS market, all indices had another positive session (with the exception of iTraxx Financial Senior which was 0.25bps wider…). The same was true for the vast majority of names, which saw their risk premia decrease across the board, and selling protection was a tough order today. One exception was NXPBV ( NXP Smeiconductors NV ). Its 5 year CDS was wider (up 2bps at 148bps), and the bid was relatively deep on the back on their $1bln convertible bond issue. The proceeds will be used to purchase stocks and repay existing loans. But if you take a few steps back and look at the 5 year CDS run over the last few years, you will see that the timing of the company is not that bad. The risk premium of NXP has never been that tight. The stock is also trading at its all-time high on the NASDAQ, and interest rates have never been that low. All in all, it is fair to say that the issue of convertible notes probably make sense… for them.
"
"CDS Remains The Hedging Tool For Choice. The 5 year risk premium of ABGSM ( Abengoa SA ) has been extremely volatile over the last couple of weeks. On the back of the well documented issues with the true extend of the company’s leverage, their cash bonds nose-dived, losing 30 points from their September peak before recovering half the lost ground. Cash was undoubtedly active during that volatile two-week-spell, but the bulk of the trading activity took place on CDS. When hell broke loose after the results release, more than $90mln CDS traded on average each day and the week after, when investors made the necessary adjustments to their portfolios, more than $170mln 5-year-CDS changed hands every day. Even on names which are fairly new to the CDS market – ABGSM only really started to trade in that format once it was introduced in the iTraxx Crossover 8 months ago -, it is the credit instrument which offers the best liquidity.
"
"Sales Begun Before Black Friday. Everyone expected a quiet session today with the US celebrating Thanksgiving and not due back in the office before tomorrow. But the trading activity turned out to be reasonable and the rally seemed to be unstoppable. Except for a few spots of weakness (ABGSM was as volatile as ever dragging ASTIM wider in its wake, and OTE’s 5 year CDS took a breather following its recent 150bps rally), most entities saw their risk premium decrease during the session. Despite that, they did not manage to keep up with the pace of the indices. iTraxx Main but especially iTraxx Crossover had their risk premia collapse at the end of the session during a late spell of short risk capitulation. That sent the bases to their theoretical prices of these 2 indices (the difference between their quoted price and the value derived from their individual constituents) to levels not seen in more than a year. Tomorrow single name CDS will have some catch up to do and the clearance of protection might well go into Black Friday.
"
"Energy Felt The Heat. This is what you get when oil tumbles 8% on Black Friday. On the one hand, retailers and delivery services enjoyed a good session as shoppers appear to go to stores and online to make the most of available deals. But on the other hands, anything related to oil and directly impacted by the falling price of crude got a beating. Higher beta names were of course the most impacted with RIG’s ( Transocean LTD ) 5 year CDS 67bps wider at 533bps and GALPPL’s ( Galp Energia SGPS SA ) 17bps wider at 258bps for instance. But even very low beta companies felt the heat. STL’s ( Statoil ) 5 year risk premium was 5bps wider at 42.5bps, TOTAL’s ( Total SA ) was 1.5bps wider at 42.5, VLO’s ( Valero Energy Corporation ) was 8.5bps wider at 95.5bps. The effects were felt on both sides of the Atlantic, but as CDX IG includes more high-beta energy related names than iTraxx Main, that led to an underperformance of the US benchmark compared to its European equivalent. CDX IG now trades 3.5bps wider than iTraxx Main. Knowing that this actually represents only half the difference between their respective fair values, that leaves some room for further underperformance of the US credit index.
"
"It Has Been A Long Way Home. Remember the VIVFP ( Vivendi SA ) that was once piling on debt to become a global media, telecoms and gaming empire? These days are gone, and over the last 2 years, VIVFP has changed its profile to a pure play media company. This transformation follows the divestments worth tens of billions of euros of Activision, GVT, Maroc Telecom and most recently SFR. The latter sale will earn VIVFP in excess of €13bln in cash, and, if the management of the company are considering extraordinary dividends and buy-backs, they will also use a good portion of that money to cut debt. All bonds which have a make whole provision will be redeemed (that concerns more than €5bn out of a total of €6.7bln) and VIVFP will begin discussions with bondholders of the tranches that do not contain a make whole call option in order to enable early repayment of these bonds if it so choses. With chatter of orphaning emerging in the market, no wonder that VIVFP’s 5 year risk premium came crashing down over the last 2 sessions. It now trades at 48bps.
"
"Will RSH Revive Off The Run CDX Indices?. Since mid-October, RSH’s ( RadioShack Corporation ) risk premium has been rising steadily, but that happened in fairly low volumes and the recent weakness was nothing usual in the US HY space which has been put under more pressure than its European equivalent. Today, events took a turn for the worst regarding the future of the company. RSH received a notice from one of its lenders that it fell out of compliance on a $250mln loan. There was no clarity on what the actual breach is, but that was enough to send the 5 year CDS more than 4 points wider. Indeed, the relationships between RSH and its creditors has been tumultuous to say the least, since they undermined the company’s turnaround plan to close 1000 stores. At 70 points upfront, protection on RSH now trades at truly distressed levels. Together with HET ( Caesars Entertainment Corp ), that is the second name in the CDX IG series 5 to 7 that does so. It looks inevitable that volumes will go up on these legacy indices, as people who own them will want to avoid the hassle of managing a default (even though it is a very smooth process). And a default of any of these 2 names will occur sooner rather than later.
"
"In The ECB We Trust. Since the last ECB meeting at the beginning of October, expectations that some sort of action will be announced by Mr Draghi tomorrow during his press conference has been steadily building up. If not a full blown QE involving sovereign bonds, at least some form of corporate bond buying program is expected. That can be seen on this grapple which shows the aggressive recent tightening of risk premia in general. What you can also see is the outperformance of iTraxx Main vs CDX IG since the beginning of last month. The oil price freefall certainly played a part as, in the US, CDX IG includes more high-beta energy companies than iTraxx Main in Europe. But even since oil stabilized over the last few days, the momentum is still stronger on European credit, and the difference between the 2 indices now sits at more than 5bps. The European benchmark has now been tighter than its US equivalent for 4 consecutive weeks. Today’s disappointing economic statistics in Europe certainly did not help investors change their mind regarding the ECB’s course of action, even if they were looking for some downside protection using short dated options. These put purchases were the only minor dent in the indefectible faith they seem to have in Mr Draghi. 
"
"BESPL: Back To Business As Usual?. As one can see on this grapple, 2014 has not been a walk in the park for BESPL’s (formerly Banco Espirito Santo and now Novo Banco S.A.) investors. Despite a brief but intense scare at the end of July, people who were owning Banco Espirito Santo’s senior risk escaped the punishment that was imposed on shareholders who lost everything. But still, the risk premium was on the rise during the summer and stable at best since October. The market had to wait until today, for Novo Banco to release their first balance sheet as of the 4th August. And numbers actually came in better than the street anticipated. Their Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, a measure of how well a bank can absorb losses, was 9.2% against expectation of 8.5%. After an initial collapse of customers’ deposits from €36bln to €25bln, the management announced that they have now recovered more than €2bln of deposits in 2 months. On the flip side, the NPL ratio has increased, but overall these numbers were received positively and people begun to question why the 5 year CDS was trading in excess of 500bps. The protection was remarked aggressively tighter, all the way down to 387bps from 497bps. The next step of the normalisation would be have a steep curve, as it is still currently deeply inverted on the short end. 
"
"Impact of Recent Oil Price Development. “It will be important to assess the broader impact of recent oil price developments on medium-term inflation trends” ECB said yesterday. The short term impact on the credit market is already obvious in the US investment grade credit market. The inflation of the oil related credit spreads. The investment grade energy sector is 50bps wider since the oil dropped last Friday. RIG ( Transocean LTD ) is trading at 615bps (+150bps), TLM  ( Talisman Energy Inc.) is trading at 450bps (+170bps) and NBR  ( Nabors Industries Ltd. ) is trading at 360bps (+150bps). These companies have altogether 20BUSD of bonds outstanding. The situation points out the conundrum of the central bankers.  They are actively easing the credit access for more private and public investments with the risk of bubble creation like the Shale Energy bubble. Avoiding deflation is the ECB mandate but creating a bubble is a risk of a larger forward deflation. Steering a tanker requires a forward-forward guidance.
"
"Russia: A Late Underperformance.. Since the beginning of the year, Russia has constantly been in the news. It all started with the Ukrainian revolution and the ousting of then President Yanukovych. It eventually led to the annexation of Crimea by Russia following a 3-month-standoff between Russia and western countries. The crisis was soon brushed aside by the market though, until new fightings appear in the Donetsk region. That sent Russia’s risk premium almost back the wides of the year, but it seemed back then that once again the market impact of these tragic events would be limited. The currency market was less sanguine about the whole situation as the rubble begun its relentless slide during the summer. But it is only when oil broke $90/barrel that the cost of insuring Russian debt really started to take off, as investors begun to anticipate serious repercussions for the Russian economy. The credit market eventually acknowledged that while western economic sanctions would leave Russia largely unscathed, a repricing of energy prices would be a serious blow to its credit worthiness.
"
"Still Plenty Of Alpha. Usually, at this time of year, people do not expect dramatic moves on risky assets as most market participants quietly await the festive period before moving on to the new year ahead. So the move by Mr Samaras to announce that the President elections will take place in December rather than February came as a somewhat unpleasant surprise, especially considering that the results (which decide whether Greece needs to hold general elections in the first quarter of 2015) will most likely not be known until the 29th December, when liquidity will be thin to say the least. That dampened the enthusiasm that had characterised the market recently, and credit indices were wider across the board, with iTraxx Crossover and iTraxx Financial Subordinated bearing the brunt of the pain. But even if that negative environment, it was possible to identify some underperformers. OTE ( Hellenic Telecommunications Organistaion SA ) was among them of course, but TSCO ( Tesco Plc ) also saw its 5 year risk premium increase 36bps to 172bps on the back of a profit warning and dragged all the UK retailers with it, while MWDP ( Wendel SA ) was 16bps wider to 79.5bps after SGOFP ( Compagnie de Saint Gobain SA ) confirmed its bid to buy control of Sika for €2.3bln. Even during large market moves, the dispersion does not want to go away.
"
"Cheap Cheaper Cheapest?. The tightening of risk premia that the credit market has experienced over the last 6 weeks has been broadbased and relentless. The only sector that was left aside was energy, on the back on the freefall of oil prices (which lost another 4% today reaching a multi year low). The recent wobbles related to Greece since the beginning of the week pushed financials and peripheral names a tad off their tightest levels though. That leads to this relatively unusual situation where the spreads which were the tightest at the beginning of the rally are the spreads which have tightened the most in absolute terms. Some have now reached levels which most people see as incompressible, and they will soon float again the idea of ""cheap shorts"". But we have just seen that what appear cheap today can be cheaper tomorrow.
"
"Tesco: From Bad To Worst. Risky assets staged a rebound today, or at least they marked a pause in the slide which begun earlier in the week. Unfortunately for TSCO’s ( Tesco Plc ) investors, the general sentiment improvement was not enough to stop the rot with regard to the equity price (down another 2.5% today and almost 10% since Monday) nor with regard to the 5 year CDS, which was another 5bps wider at 188.5bps (52bps wider since Monday). At the beginning of the week, the management team revised down the guidance for 2015 by roughly £500mln and rating agencies put the company under review for downgrade, with the potential to push it into junk category. The verdict should come early January, after more clarification has been given on potential balance sheet repair plans. Some in the market took heart from slight tweaks in the management’s language who are “no longer ruling out a right issue” (compared with their previous “we are not doing a right issue”) and who “understand the importance of an IG rating” (compared with their earlier “it is too early to commit to an IG rating”). But flows were relatively one sided so far, and overall people were not ready to call the bottom yet.
"
"Could Christmas Be Cancelled?. What difference a week can make! 5 days ago, the only question worth asking was whether iTraxx Main would break the 50bps level before or after the New Year. Nobody thought of questioning the ability of the central banks to compress yields, and everybody associated that with tighter spreads. Since then we had the much talked about oil rout (hitting new lows today, again) and its consequences on emerging markets and Russia, and of course Greece and the possibility that Syriza could come to power in February. All this was enough to weaken somewhat investors’ conviction and some felt the need to take some chips off the table. If interest rates continued their good run during this “flight to quality” and reached historically low levels, the performance of equities and credit deteriorated throughout the week. As far as credit indices were concerned, the move was gradual in the first place as options’ gamma hedging activity provided the market with a supply of protection. But that source dried up today, and risk premia popped wider across the board. iTraxx Main is back to where it was early November, so the damage there is still contained. But in the US, CDX already suffered late November from its bigger inclusion of the energy sector, and it is closing on its widest levels of the year. Another such week and Christmas is in danger of being cancelled for investors in US credit. 
"
"Index Velocity. After threatening to rally in the morning, risk sentiment took another dive today. iTraxx Main (respectively iTraxx Crossover) traded actively between 64 and 66bps (resp. 355 and 360bps) for the first 6 hours before selling off in style, and trading up to the widest level of the day of 70bps (resp. 380bps) where it eventually closed. This large move was done in low volumes. In a typical fashion during these market accelerations, individual constituents of the indices participated in the selloff, but to a much lesser extent. The basis between all the European indices and their theoretical values stands now in positive territory. After almost a week of uninterrupted widening, bases have even reached levels which begin to appear a bit stretched particularly on iTraxx Crossover where it is worth 60cts at the close. That is the equivalent of  more than 13bps for a 5 year index, or 4% of the index risk premium. As you can observe on the Grapple, this is the first time since the launch of the current series at the beginning of October that we are in such a market configuration. Unless there is a quick snap back, it could signal the return to a more normal regime (the one which prevailed throughout 2014 until October) where indices are an hedging tool and not an investment product.
"
"$55 Per Barrel Is Good For Some. Since receiving compensation in May for the 2012 nationalization of YPF SA by Argentina, REPSM ( Repsol SA ) has been looking for acquisitions. It was inevitable that with oil down to $55 per barrel some opportunities would arise, as quite a few companies have been put under severe stress. Such was the case of TLM ( Talisman Energy Inc. ) whose 5 year risk premium had blown up since the beginning of September, trading up from 100bps to 500bps, while its stock tumbled from C$10 to C$4. Until a few days ago, TLM’s creditors and shareholders were like most investors in energy companies: very worried. It turned out that acquiring TLM would enable REPSM to replace some of the oil and gas reserves and production capacity it had to give up when it lost YPF. Out of the hundreds of companies and assets around the world REPSM has analysed, TLM was the best match and they decided to launch a $13bln bid. That certainly came as a major relief for TLM’s investors who will recoup most of their recent losses, and REPSM spotted a good opportunity. Most other energy companies are still feeling the heat.

"Did It Really Happen?. People who spent a long week-end on a remote island without internet connection and are back tomorrow morning will probably ask what the fuss was all about. After all, the Ruble is only down 4% since Friday’s close. The S&P; 500 and the Eurostoxx 50 are unchanged and credit indices are actually a tad tighter over the same period. But the picture is completely different is you look at the total variation of these assets over the last 3 days. If you take the example of iTraxx Crossover and add the values all the up and down moves since Monday morning, you get a number well in excess of 200bps (the number is 60bps for today’s session alone which felt like a walk in the park compared with yesterday’s rollercoaster) for an index which is worth 353bps as of tonight’s close. The intense volatility of the last few days is also blatant on this grapple which depicts the evolution in cents of the bases (ie the difference of the quoted value of an index and its theoretical value computed from the levels of its individual constituents) of the different European credit indices. The basis of iTraxx Crossover is unchanged on a week horizon at -45cts, but it has moved between +60cts and -60cts, and that is only looking at the closing levels. 
"
"Did Alcatel Receive A Call?. If you look at a heatmap (CDS Treemap available from the grapplestore) and set the cursor on a 1D horizon (in the top left end corner), you will get a sea of green. By the way, you will also see that people were very busy trading sovereign (last week anyway as the numbers currently provided by DTCC regard last week’s volume), and more precisely emerging markets with Russia, Turkey and Brazil occupying the largest squares. But even in this beta driven environment, some names stand out. For instance, ALUFP’s ( Alcatel Lucent SA ) 5 year risk premium closed 50bps tighter at 287bps (remember that all the risk premia in DataGrapple are based on a contract with a 100bps coupon). Indeed, the rumour has it that ALUFP and NOKIA ( Nokia Oyj ) have started talking again about a possible merger or some form of cooperation. It is a story that has been in the market for a while, as talks allegedly already took place and broke off a year ago. If you consider that ALUFP’s CDS was trading at 500bps a couple of months ago, that would be a nice Christmas gift for its creditors.
"
"Getting Ready For The Roll. Today was a rather uneventful session during which most credits were well behaved. This was probably what market participants were looking for anyway, given the incredible volatility of the previous few sessions. Unsurprisingly with the CDS roll taking place next Monday (the standard 5 year maturity contracts will then be pushed by a quarter to March 2020), risk premia were a tad tighter across the board. Current contracts will lose their “on the run” status which traditionally impairs slightly their liquidity. Most people also expect the level of the 5 year CDS not to be materially different between today and Monday, even though their maturity will have been effectively extended by 3 months: they expect that the roll up the curve that should theoretically occur will not be fully reflected in the price. There were still a few spots of weakness though, but they were contained to area where problems have been well flagged: Ukraine and Venezuela among sovereigns, some energy companies, and names which could be among the next to default (Caesars which was said to have a meeting with its first lien bondholders with a view to organise a Chapter 11 sooner rather than later after their missed coupon payment on the 15th Dec; and RSH despite the recently advertised best effort of protection sellers to keep the company afloat).
"
"The Roll. Like every business day that follows the 19th of December, today was roll day for single name CDS (not for indices which roll every 6 months in March and September). When dealers quote 5y CDS, they now quote CDS maturing in March 2020 as opposed to December 2019 up to last Friday. This can be seen on the daily variations which are based on the 5 year ""on the run"" and do not take into account the change in effective maturity. The majority of names are reddish, as one would expect them to be: with steep curves (in the investment grade universe anyway), the longer dated the CDS, the wider. But while we should expect a widening of roughly (3 year 5 year slope + 7 year 5 year slope)/16, the widening was far less across the board. We have experienced a ""bull roll"", where dealers have not reflected the full roll-up along the curve. Hence the theoretical risk premium of iTraxx Main has tightened by 2bps today, despite the widespread feeling that hardly anything happened
"
"America Receives Kudos From Europe. Today’s statistics confirmed the positive trajectory of the US economy, which has been growing in the third quarter at a pace often associated with emerging markets. The release were greeted with new record highs on US equities, but credit indices appear to be stuck around current levels, 65bps for CDX IG and 350bps for CDX HY. The energy sector is still weighting on them (overnight, S&P; made a number of changes in the oilfield sector on the back of expected drop in capex which will reduce revenues and margins in the sector), despite the recent stabilisation of oil prices. In Europe, the American economy received kudos from all asset classes, including iTraxx Main and Crossover, which saw their risk premia fell in a vacuum. They are closing on their tightest levels, and American credit indices are now trading resolutely wider than their Euro equivalents, with CDXIG (65bps) now 6.5bps on top of iTraxx Main (58.5bps). This trend seems poised to continue as, in Europe, no one is currently willing to fight the ECB. Accordingly, investors will be able to enjoy their Christmas, unless the results of the Greek elections in a few days eventually spoil the party…
"
"The Year That Was. It would have been fun if that Grapple had depicted a Christmas tree, but sometimes you just have to accept the facts. At least it has some seasonal colours (tighter risk premia are green and wider are red; the brighter the colour, the bigger the move; the larger the rectangle, the bigger the volume), and enables you to see the major themes of 2014. Sovereigns are still the most actively traded CDS, and among them Italy and Russia were the busiest. The latter, together with Ukraine and Venezuela were the clear underperformers. In the bottom left corner, you can see that the energy sector, investment grade and high yield alike, had a very tough time. In the middle section, HET and RSH, which are on the verge of default, are 2 red hot spots. In the top right corner, you will find the great beneficiaries of the year: the European financials. With the help of Mr Draghi, all the boxes without exception are green. If you look carefully, you will be able to find your favourite credits and you will be able to see how they fared against the ones you dislike the most. 

In the meantime, the whole team of DataGrapple wishes you a happy New Year!

"
"Welcome To 2015!. First of all, the DataGrapple team wishes you all a successful and prosperous 2015.

As investors came back to their desks, liquidity gradually returned to the market and the outcome was probably not what most had been wishing for during their Christmas break. After an uneventful morning session, credit resolutely headed south after oil resumed its relentless slide, flirting with the $50 mark at the close of the European markets. Credit was also affected by the news flow surrounding a potential “Grexit” which intensified over the week-end and the headache it will undoubtedly give to Mr Draghi when it will come to decide whether January 22nd is the proper date to pull the QE trigger. Even though there was no obvious sign of contagion outside Greece, it left very few names unscathed and our Grapple paints many different shades of red. Currently it seems that the market will have to deal with the very same issues that have driven performance towards the end of 2014.

"
"Volatile Basis. If you look at the daily total variation of iTraxx Corssover (the sum of the absolute value of the daily moves), 2014 was the less volatile year since the Lehman debacle, with a total variation of 1582bps which is a far cry from the 3200bps total variation observed in 2011 and 2012, or even from the 2030bps of 2013. If you look at the total variation of the index basis though, the picture is somewhat different: 2014 was less volatile (997bps in 2014 compared with 918bps in 2013, 1247bps in 2012 and 1391bps in 2011), but the discrepancies are less important, and as a portion of the index total variation it has been rising substantially. If you look at the above Grapple, you will also see that as 2014 wore on, the basis became more and more volatile. This phenomenon has been amplified by the constant stop and go experienced by the market towards the end of the year. Contradicting forces (CB relentless interventions, drop in oil, turmoil in Russia, political uncertainty in Greece) have pushed credit indices back and forth, while their fair values were more stable, as single name traders waited for trends to be confirmed before changing their prices. The beginning of 2015 is no different, and investors’ nervousness is palatable. That should make 2015 an interesting vintage for basis trading. 
"
"Basis Explains Everything. We had the move out since the beginning of the week, with credit indices flirting the recent wides of the series 22 (since the beginning of November that is). With the bottom in oil price not in sight yet and bad vibes coming out Germany regarding Greece, the tone was very cautious to say the least on Monday and Tuesday. But that cautiousness was expressed almost exclusively using indices, while their constituents were left largely unchanged (they were a little wider, but not by much). That sent the basis to local highs at +50cts on iTraxx Crossover, the most sensitive of all indices. Today, we had the move in, and it was all about consolidation. Indices retraced a good portion of the move wider, buoyed by Mrs Merkels comments regarding a potential Greek debt burden easing. But in a similar fashion, single name CDS were hardly touched. While iTraxx Crossover closed 15bps tighter, its fair value was a meagre 1.5bps tighter. And the basis went all the way down to -23cts. The basis is often seen as the speedometer on the credit market: it seems investors started full throttle only to stand on the brakes a couple of days later.
"
"Who Was Left Out Of Today’ Rally?. As QE is taking centre stage again, risky assets enjoyed a positive session across the board. After a strong buy quiet start, equity and credit alike benefitted in the afternoon from the publication on the ECB website of a letter by Mario Draghi stating that policy makers may add measures that include buying sovereign bonds. But that did not prevent some names to have a difficult time. TSCO’s ( Tesco Plc ) 5 year risk premium closed 20bps wider despite announcing a better trading update than investors had anticipated. While that was enough to push the stock 16% higher, credit investors were spooked by the fact the company could not be doing enough to keep its investment status. AIRFP ( Airbus Group NV ) and ROLLS ( Rolls Royce Holding Plc ) also saw their 5-year-CDS widen meaningfully (by 12bps and 7.5bps respectively), but for reasons they cannot control. They have large currency exposures that they hedge with banks through derivatives products. As the USD experienced big moves against most currencies, these contracts saw their market values move meaningfully, generating exposure for the banks which wrote them (AIRFP and ROLLS now potentially owe them money). That is why the CVA desks of these banks have been out in the market trying to buy protection, sending their risk premia higher.
"
"Financials Are The Laggards. It has been a volatile beginning of the year. For all risky assets the first full week of January has been a roller-coaster ride. Credit indices experienced wild swings, with iTraxx Main trading between 61bps and 67bps, and iTraxx Crossover between 368bps and 333bps. But after 6 trading sessions, the year to date changes are minimal across the board. There is one exception though, the financial sector. It saw its risk premia increase up to Wednesday like every other sector, but failed to take part in the rally which followed. iTraxx Financials Senior has widened 8bps from 63bps to 71bps. That is down to a slight increase in basis (13cts or a tad less than 3bps), but most names actually closed wider on the period. There was some good news though, like the €7.5bln capital increase of SANTAN ( Banco Santander SA ) – stock holders might disagree with the “good news” label – or some m&a; rumours – MONTE was said to be a target for SANTAN leading to a 30bps tigntening yesterday -, but on the whole investors are still wary of potential exposure to Russia, of what the impact of the Greek elections could be, and of who might be left out of the ECB bond buying program.

"
"PORTEL: The Odd One Out. Despite some volatility, the credit market felt resilient today and credit indices closed tighter across the board, even though they underperformed equities. But some names are currently having a tough time, and most notably PORTEL ( Portugal Telecom SGPS SA). In fact, it has been the case since the beginning of the year: while iTraxx Crossover is a bit tighter year to date, PORTEL’s 5 year risk premium is 76bps wider. It has been rumoured for some time that PORTEL’s shareholders could agree to postpone a vote on whether to sell assets to Altice during their meeting today, and this effectively happened. The vote will not be held until the 22nd January, as some fear the deal could endanger the proposed merger between PORTEL and the Brazilian carrier Oi, which has already been complicated by the PORTEL’s catastrophic investment in Rioforte papers. The asset sale to Altice might not make a material difference to PORTEL’s fundamentals as the money would probably be spent on TIM anyway, but the announcement of the vote’s delay certainly added to uncertainty and contributed to the negative feeling towards the name.
"
"CDX / iTraxx Main Divergence.  Recently the financial sector in Europe has underperformed as investors were trying to gauge the impact of the Greek elections and of the deteriorating Russian situation (the Rubble is quickly closing on its weakest level against the USD) with regards to banks. But an even more powerful trend has been the weakening of credits in the energy sector in the US. That situation is best illustrated by the recent move among the dealer community to quote RIG’s ( Transocean Ltd ) risk premium in points upfront instead of a running spread, a situation that typically affects a company when it switches from investment grade to high yield. It has led to a meaningful underperformance of the CDX IG (which now trades at 70.5bps) compared with iTraxx Main (which now trades at 61.25bps) during the last few sessions, but also since the last index roll when the most recent series were both launched at 66bps. This situation could be here to stay as the spread between the theoretical values of these two indices is even wider and stands at 14bps (77.35bps vs 63.37bps). 
"
"SUNCOM’s IPO Will Eventually Happen. As you can see on the above Grapple, it is not the first time SUNCOM’s (Sunrise Communications) IPO is rumoured in the market: Except that this time, it will actually happen. The second largest telecom carrier in Switzerland plans a public listing in the first half of the year. Considering competition in the Swiss mobile market will likely increase following the acquisition of Orange Switzerland by Xavier Niel, the move by CVC to monetise some of the investment it made in 2010 is not that surprising. The proceeds of the IPO should amount to CHF1.35bln and will enable Sunrise to deleverage its balance sheet and reduce the cost of debt. Combine with a reduction in capex to more normal levels following a few years of heavy investment, this will allow the company ?to implement an attractive and sustainable shareholder distribution policy?, it said. If all goes according to plan, the only bond left should eventually be CHF370m of secured notes maturing in 2017 and callable at 101.406 from 31 July 2015. Investors considered that this story has ?orphaning? written all over it with regards to SUNCOM’s CDS, and they sent it 83bps tighter.
"
"Fancy Owning Protection For Free?. Since oil began its free fall 6 months ago, investors started buying protection on names within the energy sector, driving their risk premia through the roof. Over the last 6 months, in the US, the average 5 year CDS of energy companies has widened by 175bps from 79bps to 254bps. RIG’s ( Transocean Ltd ) 5 year CDS has ballooned from 150bps to 853bps. To finance these CDS purchases, investors have sold credit indices, and in this instance CDX IG. These 2 contradicting forces (buyers of single name CDS and sellers of CDX IG) have been at work in the market since the launch of the series 23, and the quoted value of CDXIG23 has never traded above the theoretical value implied by its constituents. This chronically negative basis was worth -30cts at the close, but was down to -40cts during the session. At that point, buying protection on $125m index and selling 1m protection on all the constituents would have made you 500k$ (125m x 40cts). If you want to buy protection to December 2019 (the maturity of CDXIG23) on RIG and AVP ( Avon Products Inc ), which are the 2 widest names included in CDXIG23, you will have to pay 845bps and 690bps respectively, which over the course of life of these products (factoring in some default probability) will cost you roughly 300k$ and 260k$ to insure $1m of each. So why don’t you buy protection on $125m and sell protection on all the names in the index except RIG and AVP. That will (almost) not cost you a cent until December 2019 and you will effectively own $1m protection of each… That sounds better than buying single name CDS and selling index to get some carry back!
"
"The Week That Was. This Grapple gives you a glimpse of what happened since the beginning of the week. The bigger the rectangle, the busier the name was (the daily volumes are taken from DTCC and actually relate to the week before, ie currently to the week that ended on the 9th January) . Green means a decreasing risk premium, and red means a deterioration in the perception by the market of the credit quality of the mentioned company. First you can see that the bulk of the trading in CDS still takes places in the sovereign space by a fair margin. Then, even though credit is ending the week on a bullish note on the back of headlines regarding Mr Draghi presenting a QE plan to the German government, the brighter spots are red and they are quite numerous. There is no surprise there though, as the names which underperformed are linked one way or the other to commodities: GLEINT ( Glencore Plc ) and AALLN ( Anglo American Plc ) on the back of the volatility which affected metals, and once again the whole energy sector both in the US and in Europe which, despite today’s rebound in oil, which saw petrol trading through the $50/barrel level for the first time in more than 5 years. 
"
"How Can FX Moves Impact CDS. The FX market has been the topic of many debates following the dramatic moves of last week after the Swiss Central Bank decided to abandon the Swiss Franc floor of 1.2 per Euro. The dramatic swings that followed in FX land created some volatility on equities and interest rates, but far less so on credit. In fact, the impact of FX moves on CDS are not necessarily intuitive and are often more technical than fundamental. For instance, the companies whose risk premia were the most impacted are companies which have effectively hedged their (big, because they are exporting companies) FX exposure! Companies usually do so by entering derivative products with banks. These contracts are usually not covered by any margin call agreement. So when their market value move against the companies which face the banks, the latter can potentially be owed big amounts of money, creating some credit exposure which the banks will try and hedge. To do so, banks will buy some 5 year CDS referencing these companies, but also shorter dated maturities as some FX derivative contracts expire sooner, and also because shorter dated CDS are less expensive. This results in wider CDS and flatter curves for the companies. That is exactly what you see on the above Grapple, which plots the evolution of the 3 year 5 year CDS curve as a function of the 5 year spread since the beginning of last week (during which the USD kept appreciating vs the Euro). The head of the pins represents the most recent data point. While most pins should point left because of the general move tighter, all the car manufacturers point right (their risk primia have increased) and down (their risk premium curve is flatter).
"
"IPO Everywhere. One of the trades people are currently looking at is decompression. It should work in a bearish scenario. And even if the widely anticipated ECB quantitative easing triggers some further spread tightening, there are mitigating factors. Although it is not clear whether the ECB will end up buying corporate bonds, if it does, it will center on the better quality credits and this aspect should benefit investment grade considerably more than high yield. But in the meantime, the nerves of investors who have implemented this strategy through indices in Europe have been tested by the recent news flow. There were some orphaning stories in iTraxx Crossover, and a few moves that took place on the back of M&A; stories, particularly companies being IPOed. The telco industry has been the most fertile sector in that respect with the recent example of SUNCOM (Sunrise Communications), but today was all about SHAEFF (Schaeffler). An article in the press suggested the company could IPO its ball bearing division (more likely part of it), which is valued at €13-15bln. They do not really need the cash given their positive FCF, but it could be used as a currency for M&A.; So there is a decent probability that the proceeds might not be used towards deleveraging the company, but the market sent SHAEF’s risk premium 30bps tighter to 144bps nevertheless.
"
"Does Index Alone Give The Whole Picture?. In Europe, activity was fairly subdued during the first part of the session. Given the level of expectations that built up ahead of tomorrow’s ECB’s meeting it was not surprising to see investors remain on the side-lines. Then the headline hit that QE might amount to €50bln per month through 2016, so a fair amount more than the €700bln rumoured last week. That triggered some protection selling on indices across the board, sending iTraxx Main and iTraxx Crossover 1.5bps tighter to 56.5bps and 10bps tighter to 323bps respectively in a flurry of trading. So from that angle, the European credit market looks pretty bulled up. But at the same time, the implied volatility of credit indices options was consistently bid up throughout the session. On the February expiry, which is the shortest to capture the ECB’s meeting, the price of out of the money options (typically with a 25% delta) went up by 6 volatility points. Investors have been busy buying protection against tail risk, just in case the market is disappointed by tomorrow’s actual decision.
"
"Is iTraxx Financial Tighter Than iTraxx?. For the first time in a while, the theoretical value of ITXES522 (iTraxx Financials Senior 5 year series 22, the on the run index), which now stands at 58.0 bps, has gone through the theoretical value of ITXEB522 (iTraxx Main Europe 5 year series 22, the on the run index), which now stands at 59bps. A very pro-active ECB eventually managed to bring the risk premia of all the peripheral banks in line with the others. That explains the gradual compression between financials’ and other investment companies’ risk premia in Europe. As investors felt more confident regarding the prospects of European credits as a whole on the back of the ECB action, they have sold protection on iTraxx Main. That now translates into a deeply negative basis, iTraxx Main is trading 4bps tighter (or 20 cents more expensive) than its theoretical value. At the same time, tensions between Russia and Ukraine have not abated and elections will be held in Greece over the week-end, which could raise questions about some financials which represent a big chunk of most investment portfolios. So any hedging activity done with indices lead almost inevitably to a persistent bid on iTraxx Financials, which is the case at the moment and has led to a positive basis. The difference in basis explains why iTraxx Main is 5bps tighter than iTraxx Financials even though its fair value is 1bp wider.
"
"NSINO’s Roller Coaster Ride . Since the beginning of the year, NSINO ( Norske Skogindustrier ) has been one of the best performing credit. This was attributed to different factors that currently benefit the company: the falling price of energy (they use a lot of it) and the falling price of the Norwegian Krone against the USD and the Euro (while less than 10% of the group’s revenue are generated in NOK, more than a third of their production capacity is located in Norway). But yesterday we got what is probably a more convincing explanation of this stellar performance. The management announced the launch of €250mln Senior Secured Notes due in December 2019. They will use the proceeds in an offer to exchange existing bonds for a mix of cash and 2021 notes in a bid to extend their debt maturity. If the take up of the offer is large, the exchange will result in a material strengthening of NSINO’s balance sheet, increasing liquidity, pushing out existing maturities and reducing net leverage. When the news first broke, there was speculation that the new bonds, which will rank senior to existing bonds included in the offer, would be issued out of a new box. The 5 year CDS hit an air pocket yesterday at the close on the back of these orphaning fears and traded down 12pts, from 38pts to 26pts (that is a 800bps tightening). As these fears dissipated today, NSINO’s risk premium traded all the way back to the previous days’ level, sending it on one of the most spectacular roller coaster ride we have been given to witness in a while. In any case, a much reduced funding gap risk in 2015 should result in a steeper curve.
"
"The Impact Of Greek Elections. Today’s comments are unanimous, the results of the Greek elections over the week-end had no impact whatsoever on investors’ risk appetite generally speaking. There was a small blip at the open this morning, but when it was clear that there would be no real follow through, risky assets begun to rally across the board. That was certainly true for credit indices, and their risk premia closed tighter without exception. But if you look a bit more closely, buying Greek risky assets was much cheaper today than it was last Friday. The Greek 10 year bond benchmark lost 5% for instance. OTE’s ( Hellenic Telecommunications Organisation SA ) 5 year risk premium had to trade more than 50bps wider at 425bps before buyers of risk eventually emerged, and it actually felt more like profit taking rather than new risk being added. It would sound reasonable for investors to have a bit more information before deeping their toes back into Greek waters. It remains to be seen whether they can resist for long the temptation of juicier yields.
"
"Suspicion Around Financials. Today was weak across the board. Investors are trying to evaluate the impact on their portfolios of the many different stories that recently made the front page of the papers, and the tone was definitely more cautious on financial companies, particularly banks. The confrontational stance which could be adopted by the newly elected Greek government and the downgrade of Russia were among factors dampening sentiment, but the catalyst for the sector’s underperformance was  Raiffeisen Bank International AG , which saw its subordinated bonds trade aggressively down (most of them are now worth hardly more than 50cts on the dollar). It is feared that the international arm of the Austrian cooperative banking group may be forced into a dilutive cash call. Concerns are mounting regarding risks in Russia, Ukraine and also the appreciating Swiss Franc, a factor that has affected Austrian banks on the back of their ties with Hungary and Poland.
"
"The Reporting Circus Is In Town. With the emphasis put on macro factors recently - from the escalating conflict in Ukraine to results of the Greek elections or the launch of full blown QE in Europe -, one would be forgiven to forget about the reporting season which has been in full swing since the last few weeks. But today shows that results still matters and can impact the price of risky assets. For instance, FNCIM (Finmeccanica Spa) raised its 2014 revenues guidance to EUR14.4-14.7Bln, orders guidance to EUR15.2-15.5Bln and their Ebita estimate to EUR1.04-1.06bln. The management also announced that debt would go down from the current EUR4.1bln to less than EUR3.5bln by 2017. FNCIM will scale back its product line and focus on non-military markets. Investors showed their appreciation by sending the stock up 2.5% and the 5 year risk premium 12bps tighter to 134bps. If you play with the timeframe menu in the top left corner of the chart, you will see that is the tightest level since the beginning of 2011.
"
"It Rocks On The Way Out Too. A couple of weeks ago, ISOLUX announced their intention to proceed with a €600mln IPO. The news was caught in the frenzy surrounding the Swiss Franc debacle and went unnoticed to anyone not specialising in High Yield. Nevertheless, the 5 year risk premium collapsed more than 150bps on the day the deal was made public. Today, after some rumours in the Spanish press that the IPO might be pulled, the company confirmed that it would not happen, not right away in any case. The market has so far proved generally resilient to the Greek situation, but the energy sector was always the most at risk for that kind of event considering the fall in oil price. On the back of ISOLUX’s involvement in solar energy, wind energy and in biofuel, it might not be that surprising that the company said it believed that the preliminary valuation indications do not recognize the full potential of the company’s asset base at this time”. That sent its 5 year risk premium through the roof, 165bps wider at 800bps. There were quite a few companies which recently told the market of their intention to raise cash by issuing stocks, and their CDS have accordingly ripped tighter. Let’s see if ISOLUX will be the odd one out or if it will just be the first to fall.  
"
"The Maturity Of The Risk Matters. NSINO ( Norske Skogindustrier ) announced last week a new senior secured bond deal, combined with a proposed exchange offer for the existing unsecured notes. If the exchange is successful, most of the 2015/2016/2017 notes will be redeemed, and a portion of the claim of present creditors will be rolled into new notes maturing in 2021. While contradicting views on the medium term prospects of the company have led to an incredible spell of volatility on the 5 year risk premium, investors expect the proposed deal to go through and see default risk as dramatically lower through the end of 2016. If you  play with the maturity of the risk premium in the top right corner you will see that while the 5 year maturity has been all over the place, the 1 year has been much more stable after the initial repricing.
"
"Indices Up... Single Names Down!. The daily variations of indices did not really reflect the sentiment today. They are closing tighter across the board, but only on the back of 45 minutes of agressive protection selling into the close. Single name CDS gave a mixed picture though, and they are closing wider on average. Basic Material suffered from the reported slowdown in China (first sub 50 PMI print in January since September 2012). The sentiment on financials is still dampened by the uncompromising stance adopted by the new Greek government regarding their debt negotiations. Consumer Non-Cyclicals were weighted down by the UK retailers. Their 5 year risk premia were marked up as people fear profit warnings maybe on their way in the sector, starting with MRWLN (Wm. Morrisson Supermarkets Plc). At the other end, the energy sector had some respite, on the back of the rebound of oil above $50 per barrel.
"
"Buy The Rumour Sell The News. Risk premia of companies within the basic materials sector have been under a lots of pressure recently. They have all widened meaningfully since September and most, like MTNA (ArcelorMittal SA), actually gapped wider over the last few sessions. Unsurprisingly, rating agencies have been monitoring this industry recently. S&P; is currently reviewing Metals & Miners, and today they begun with Europe, downgrading MTNA from BB+ to BB. But that move had been largely anticipated as the factors which contributed to the rating downgrade were well known. In fact, if anything, S&P;’s EBITDA forecast surprised the market on the upside. Investors decided then to focus on the stable outlook, and considered that a BB rating was already largely priced in. It ensued a spell of profit taking from those who had accumulated short risk positions on the name, and MTNA’s 5 year CDS closed 31bps tighter at 324bps.

"There Can Be Only One. In an effort to avoid the fate of RSH (RadioShack Corporation) which seems bound to file for bankruptcy protection, SPLS (Staples Inc) and ODP (Office Depot Inc) have been linked for a while. They eventually announced a deal overnight, in which SPLS will buy ODP for $7.3Bln. That will reduce the US office-supply industry to a single major chain and will probably test the limits of anti-trust regulators. Even though investors suspected a transaction was coming, the cash element was always the big question mark. It came at the higher end of people’s expectations, and the deal will require $4.3Bln in new debt. The company leverage should go from up from the current 3x to 4.25 or 4.5x depending on the synergies they can achieve. There should be a multi-notch downgrade and analysts expect the 5 year risk premium to trade close to 300bps if the acquisition go through. As it is not a done deal, the CDS stopped at 220bps, but that is still a good 45bps wider on the day.
"
"Credit Is A Rock. Since the beginning of the year, a quick poll among market participants on all asset classes will produce a unanimous answer: “volatility is back”. Rates, equities, currencies, commodities have all already experienced wild swings in 2015. In that respect, credit seems to be the odd one out. There were some moves, but they have been fairly orderly. That can be seen on the above grapple which graphs the basis of iTraxx Crossover (i.e. the difference between the quoted value of the index and the theoretical value derived from the prices of its constituents). This index is usually the most volatile, and the daily changes in the basis are an indication of the velocity of the market. Indices serve as investors’ favourite hedging tool, and they tend to react quicker to news than single name CDS. Despite a few bumps, the basis has been stubbornly negative (the index risk premium is tighter than the risk premia of its constituents) and has stayed in a narrow range.
"
"Orphan… And Then Not. The 5 year risk premium of SUNCOM (Sunrise Communications) has experienced a fairly bumpy ride over the last few years. It has move up and down like its fellow crossover names of course, but it also hit some air pockets at times, whenever IPO rumours were surfacing and of course when they were confirmed a few weeks ago. Back then people also widely assumed that the entity which has so far issued Sunrise’s debt (Sunrise Communications Holdings SA) would no longer be an active issuer. With the existing unsecured notes called as part of the IPO financing, it had “orphan” written all over it. On top of the obvious deleveraging story, this was one of the reasons for the collapse of SUNCOM’s 5 year CDS to 100bps. Today the IPO took place, putting a large smile on the face of the investors who subscribed, as the stock closed 12% higher than its issue price on its trading debut in Zurich. It was a different story for people who kept some exposure to the CDS though. Indeed, the borrowing entity of the new post-IPO secured 2022 notes will eventually be… Sunrise Communications Holdings SA. That sent SUNCOM’s CDS 40bps wider to 138bps. Unlike us humans, a CDS is orphan until it is not.
"
"Is Lanxess Done With Synthetic Rubber?. Like most other high beta names, LXSGR (Lanxess AG) was put under pressure first thing this morning on the back of worrying signals coming from the current stand-off regarding the debt of Greece. But all that changed at the end of the morning when it surfaced that LXSGR could be looking to sell a stake in its synthetic-rubber unit and form a joint-venture. If it happens, the transaction will improve the overall business profile by helping reduce their reliance on the cyclical rubber unit. Depending on the partner in the JV, it could also help them getting access to cheaper raw materials. And finally, it would give LXSGR the option to either reduce their leverage or use the proceeds to buy other assets and further enhanced their portfolio mix. After initially having traded up to 100bps, LXSGR’s 5 year risk premium eventually closed 8bps tighter at 90bps in an otherwise cautious market.
"
"If You Blinked You Probably Missed It. The credit market is closing unchanged across the board. Indices hardly moved on a close to close basis, so you would be forgiven to think investors are very relaxed about the outcome of the negotiations between Greece and its European creditors. Those who were behind their screens watching the market will tell you a different story though, and there is little doubt that the next few weeks will bring some decent moves one way or another. While risk premia were slowly drifter wider in the morning, headlines of the European Commission offering a 6-month-extension to Greece so that they can renegotiate their debt send credit indices aggressively tighter (2.5bps on iTraxx Main and 12bps on iTraxx Crossover). They eventually stabilised, but shortly gapped back to their opening levels, when German officials denied the existence of such a compromise. Don’t let today’s daily moves fool you, the market consider there is much at stake in the current negotiations. 
"
"CDS: It Gets Liquid When It Gets Hot. Over the last 6 months, macroeconomic have played an overwhelming role in the behaviour of risky assets’ price. Russia, Greece, Oil prices, Quantitative Easing have dominated the headlines and they have largely driven the market ups and downs. That said, idiosyncratic news have also played their part for a few names. For instance TSCOLN ( Tesco Plc) has been regularly under the spotlight since they identified accounting irregularities back in September 2014. It is quite striking that not only TSCO’s 5 year risk premium has moved meaningfully when there was some new information reaching the market, but that traded volumes also increased significantly around these dates. Rather than selling bonds which can prove tricky to replace afterwards, CDS provides investors with an efficient and liquid hedging instrument when they expect a bumpy ride on a given credit.
"
"Investors Worry About Greece. Whatever they say, investors worry about Greece. That is best shown by the relationship between the US and European investment grade indices. Because of the different trajectories of their economies and because of their different exposure to the energy sector, the risk premium asked for CDXIG and iTraxx Main (ITXEB) had been on a diverging path since October. For months CDXIG had consistently underperformed ITXEB. From trading flat to each other, CDXIG ended 14bps wider than ITXEB on the 26th January. That all changed with the outcome of the Greek elections. Despite a brief respite during the first week of February, ITXEB has underperformed CDXIG by 6bps since then. That underperformance comes of course from the behaviour of their respective constituents, with banks weighting on ITXEB (they are not represented within CDXIG). But half of it comes from a change in basis, which has gone from -23cts to +4cts (that is a change 5.5bps) for ITXEB since the 26th January while it has gone from -32cts to -24cts on CDXIG (that is a change of 2bps). Investors have been much busier buying systemic protection against an accident in Europe (either directly on indices or via options) than they have been in the US.
"
"Liquidity Matters. It was a relatively strong session across the board, and all credit indices have seen their risk premia decrease during the day. There were a few bumps along the road as investors are still keeping a nervous eye on the news flow regarding Greece. Mr Juncker provided the spark today when he said a deal was still far away, but that was eventually shrugged off and the bulls won the contest. One index moved in a straight line though: iTraxx Financial Sub (ITXEU). It collapsed 9bps today, from 140.5bps to 131.5bps. Of course investors are looking for yield and high spreads are always going to be on their shopping list when the market rallies, but the theoretical value of ITXEU only moved by 5.5bps, leaving the other 3.5bps to a change in basis. It was a typical example of bad market positioning on an index which has experienced patchy liquidity for some time. 
"
"Moody’s Can Still Surprise The Market. In the recent past, most of the rating actions by the different agencies had been well anticipated by the market, and investors’ reaction was often an illustration of the “buy the rumour, sell the news” adage. Over the week-end though, Moody’s managed to surprise the market when they upgraded ELEPOR ( EDP – Energias de Portugal SA) to Baa3 with a stable outlook (prev. Ba1 with positive outlook). The upgrade in itself was not a surprise as many analysts have argued for some time that ELEPOR’s credit profile was consistent with a mid-BBB rating (S&P; changed the outlook on its BB+ rating to positive only 3 weeks ago), but the timing was definitely sooner than most were anticipating. Moody’s action means that the average rating of ELEPOR is now investment grade (IG) and the company’s bonds will qualify for the different iBoxx IG indices. That brought strong buying interest from IG funds which was only met with High Yield funds taking profit once the bonds were up 2.5 or 3 points, which in turn sent the 5 year risk premium 20bps tighter at 101.5bps. It could well only be the beginning of a volatile spell, as the company was quick to announce towards the end of the session their plan to issue 10-year bonds.
"
"The Greece/EuroGroup Barometer. Investors have been paying a lot of attention to the developments in the negotiations between Greece and their European creditors recently. That has led to many stop and go situations for risky assets. The range has not been very wide on credit indices (5bps on iTraxx Main since the beginning of February and 18bps on iTraxx Crossover), but we have visited both the tight and wide ends a few times already since the 1st of February. The frequency of these vibrations has been quite high and single names’ risk premia have struggled to keep pace. In the end, the moves of the theoretical values of credit indices have been muted and the volatility was essentially down to change in basis. Over the last 2 weeks, the basis of iTraxx Crossover, the most volatile of the credit index family, was a good indication of the progress made by Mr Varoufakis and his European counterparts. 
"
"The Tide Lifts (Almost) All Boats. Looking at the price action since the beginning of the week, the market seems underinvested, and today credit outperformed other asset classes on no new news. The price action on European High Yield cash is still a bit timid, but the rally gained traction on most single name CDS. Even PEUGOT (Peugeot SA) which announced disappointing results saw its 5 year risk premium closing 8bps tighter at 168bps. On a day like today, anything with beta had to rally, and OTE (Hellenic Telecommunications Organization S.A.) led the charge, closing 30bps tighter at 462bps. Only a handful of names resisted the move. The most notable two were NSINO ( Norske Skogindustrier ) which is still struggling to get its bondholders agree to its debt swap, and NUMFP (Numericable SFR SA) in which ALTICE has proposed to buy the 20% stake still held by VIVFP (Vivendi SA). This operation will require some debt issuance and investors suspect it will come the NUMFP box. 
"
"CDS Tighter… Curves Unchanged!. At the beginning of the year, a number of analysts recommended investors to position themselves on the longer end of the curve. In a yield hungry market, they argued that longer dated maturities would entice people. This grapple plots the difference between 10-year and 5-year-risk premia for the different sectors in the European investment grade universe as a function of the 5-year-risk-premia. It is obvious for all to see that 5-year-risk premia have decreased across the board, as all the pin-heads are pointing left. But it is also obvious that all these pins are almost horizontal. So if 10-year-risk premia are tighter, there was hardly any benefit (if any) in selling longer dated protection compared with selling standard 5-year-contracts. This is consistent with a number of issuers coming to the market with new deals in the 8 to 10 year maturity bucket since the beginning of the year (money is currently free, so why not lock it for the longest possible period), thus putting a bit of pressure on longer dated yields. 
"
"HET (Caesar): Bets Are Off. The HET’s (Caesar) saga eventually came to an end, as far as CDS are concerned anyway. After a protracted legal debate, it was decided a couple of weeks ago that the company effectively defaulted on the 15th January 2015, and the auction settling the pay-out of protection buyers was held yesterday. They will receive 84.125cts per dollar of protection they owned. That also means that HET was stripped of the CDXHY index yesterday night. The CDXHY series 23 now includes 99 names, and one of the distressed names has been removed. Because the risk premium of CDXHY can very roughly be seen as the average risk premium on its constituents, CHXHY was 20bps tighter today. But because CDXHY23 still includes RSH (Radioshack) which officially defaulted on February 5th and which also has a very wide risk premium, it is still artificially wide, and will remain so until the auction settling the payout of CDS buyers takes place. This auction should be held early March, and everything else being equal, CDXHY will be another 20bps tighter the next day. That will send CDXHY23 to its tighter level ever, and, because of the stress in some HY compartments like energy for instance, many start to question the level it is trading at. CDXHY/CDXIG decompression will no doubt be a recurrent theme over the next few months.
"
"iTraxx Crossover Basis, the cheap hedge. In a candlestick chart,   the candlewick displays the high and the low over a given period, while the candle displays the variation over the same period. With a full candle, the data is wider, with an empty candle, the data is tighter. On today's Grapple, we can see first that the iTraxx Europe Crossover basis (BTXEX) has this year the largest amplitude, between -70cts and 40cts (around -14bps to +8bps) and, second, that this basis is at the lowest level of the year. Even if the Greek single names CDS prices at falling today like  Hellenic Telecommunications (-20bps) or Public Power Corporation (-2.75%), this is far from being sufficient to explain the index trading level.  The environment is positive on the short term for the European high yield market with large inflows. But on many names the spread valuation is providing little room for further tightening given the credit fundamentals. The basis is the expression of this strong imbalance between a top down approach and bottom up approach of the credit. The first approach is much faster to change than the second one. Buying protection on the index while selling on the single name should benefit from a reversal. The basis should attract a lot of investors at this level, the basis is a cheap hedge.
"
"Squaring the Circle. From US to Europe, the various parties achieved to deliver the market expectations. All assets are performing : the CDS are closing tighter, the treasuries higher like the stock market.  Over the week, the spread tightening is close to the perfection. On this Grapple, all bubbles are aligned. The CDS tightening is proportional to the CDS level. This is a clean homogeneous risk premium compression in the European credit market.  We can wonder if this is completely rational. But, as far as we can understand, the Eurogroup has achieved squaring   the debt’s circle with the Greek government. So, why the bubbles couldn't be aligned again the next trading sessions?
"
"Après-Ski. For those enjoying the ski season, DataGrapple offers to catch up with what is happening on the CDS market in these incredible times.  DataGrapple does work on the ski lifts (with a large screen) but the data are updated only when you are already enjoying the après-ski.  My preferred Grapple today is the candlestick Grapple on the Europe High Yield Universe. What you need to know can be sum up easily: (1) Greek corporate CDS, Hellenic Telecommunications Organization SA and Public Power Corp SA, had a very bumpy course but they are now trading at the tightest level of the year; (2) a couple of names are missing the rally like Portugal Telecommunication SGPS which is a very active CDS, trading around 30MUSD per day.  With no surprise, Russian banks are still trading very wide for a reason.  Financière Quick and Stretford 79 Plc are lagging and we can really worry on the fate of these 2 LBOs.
"
"Transocean: downgraded to junk, tighter. Moody’s downgraded RIG ( Transocean LTD ) to Ba1 outlook stable. RIG will be out of the new series CDX.IG.NA Series 24 to be issued next month.  Just a couple of hours later, RIG released its earnings for the fourth quarter which came better than the market consensus on aggressive costs cutting and slashing dividend . The junk status can be justified given the uncertainty on the oil industry but the CDS has tightened sharply by 50bps before closing 35 bps tighter. The CDS dynamic is a function of the fear and could trade back below 500bps if the company keeps adjusting its capacity and hoarding cash. This name is actively traded in CDS as 90MUSD have traded in average per day last week according to DTCC as you can see on the Grapple. That is 2.5% of the company public debt.
"
"Rearview Grapple. The psychodrachma subsided this week and the European Investment Grade credit index is closing at its tightest level since the end of 2007. The full effect of the quantitative easing coupled with large inflows in high yield funds had a relentless effect on the CDS market. All risk premia have collapsed: curves are flatter, the iTraxx Europe Financial Senior is back close to the iTraxx Europe, iTraxx Europe is outperforming the CDX.NA.IG closing at 49.5 versus 61.5. The Grapple provides a full picture of the market over the last 9 years. The trend is obvious but the market has been a succession of squeeze and pullback. So March will as interesting as February, including the credit indices roll.
"
"The Birth Of A Giant. Most of the names traded sideways in the credit market today. Given the tight level of the risk premia, that can only be described as undeniable strength. One rare wobble came from NXP (NXP Semiconductors NV). The company announced overnight that it is buying Freescale for $11.8Bln, in a combination of cash and stocks. It aims to expand its market share in chips for cars, surfing the trend pointing to vehicle that drive themselves. The deal will be funded with $1bln and $1bln in new debt, which means an increase in net leverage from 1.7x to 3.5x. The initial reaction was to send the 5 year CDS 20bps wider. But there has been a lot of short risk positions built recently in the name in anticipation of such an operation, making it one of only a handful of names trading hardly tighter since the beginning of the year. Now that the deal turning two challengers into a giant has materialised, this CDS felt pretty squeezy and it closed only marginally wider at 149bps (it is wider as what some see on their screen as all the risk premia in DataGrapple are computed using a 100bps running coupon, and not the 500bps which is standard on NXP).
"
"Are Financials Tired?	. Core banks risk premia have been widening for a few days, or at least they failed to participate in any meaningful way in the last part of the rally. Today, the peripherals were a bit under pressure, and the chronically positive bases (the risk premium of financial indices is wider than their theoretical risk premium) are providing single name CDS with a persistent bid. There was no specific piece of news (the situation affecting Heta, the Austrian bank, is too specific to impact other name at the moment), but as it looked as if that compartment of the market is feeling a bit tired currently. It is tempting to say that we could be at the beginning of a position-led selloff, but the backdrop for credit in Europe remains strong and makes it a tough call, especially with the ECB meeting on Thursday and the expected official launch of QE.
"
"The Scissors Effect. The tone continued to soften in the High Yield space in Europe today. This compartment is clearly in consolidation mode, and HY bonds closed 1/2pt lower to unchanged across the board. Unsurprisingly, the names which have outperformed recently were among the underperformers today, and that eventually fed through the CDS market. For instance, STENA was 13bps wider at 475bps (remember DataGrapple computes the risk premia using a 100bps coupon), INEGRPSA (Ineos Group Holdings SA) 19bps wider at 398bps, and WINDIM (Wind Acquisition) 10bps wider at 290bps to name a few. On the back on this consolidation move, the theoretical value of iTraxx Crossover was 3bps wider at 277bps. At the same time, a late surge in equity markets during the last 2 hours of trading brought sellers of index protection, which had traded sideways for most of the session, to the market and iTraxx Crossover closed 4bps tighter at 261.5bps. Because of this scissors effect, the basis of iTraxx Corssover closed towards its most negative level of the year. 
"
"Do You Buy Compression At These Levels?. Today, however you look at it, European credit experienced a bullish session. The tightening started from the word “go” and the market never looked back. iTraxx Main went in a straight line from 50 to 47.75bps and iTraxx Crossover went from 261.5 to 248.5bps following the same pattern. Compression between high and low beta was in full swing as iTraxx Crossover meaningfully outperformed its usual relationship to iTraxx Main. Investors also pushed curves flatter, giving long dated risk premia an extra nudge. So compression was at work on that front as well, eventually vindicated analysts who recommended earlier in the year to buy risk on longer dated maturities. 
"
"Pause For Thought. After a few days of tightening, the European credit market took a breather. It was nothing violent, and most of the names merely slowed in their grind tighter. In this grapple, when a risk premium tightens the corresponding box is green and when it widens it is red. The bigger the move the brighter the color. That gives the above grapple an almost uniform pale shade of green. Two rare reddish spots come from basic material companies. Indeed Metal and miners were the underperformers of the day and saw their risk premia widened 8-10bps as flows were dominated by longs going through a round of profit taking and new short being initiated. That pushed AALLN (Anglo American Plc) 9bps wider at 154bps and GLEINT (Glencore Plc) 7bps wider at 146.5bps. To put things in perspective, you can choose a different time span by clicking on any of available maturities in the top left corner. Any choice from a one-week-horizon to a year-to-date performance will generate very bright shades of green across the board.
"
"No End In Sight For Dispersion. For the market as a whole, the session felt like a walk in the park, and failed to provide much excitement. After a quick wobble at the open following the weak close in the US on Friday, sellers of protection rapidly emerged (they probably took comfort in the effective start of QE which sent bund 1 figure higher) and capped any index widening, making sure that the trading range remained narrow. It was a fairly different story if you go into the details though. The constituents of iTraxx Crossover for instance experienced very different fortunes. While PIZEXP’s (Pizza Express) was 27.5bps tighter at 398bps on the back on the results it published today, other names were marked substantially wider. The difficulties currently met by the Greek government in their debt negotiations with the Eurogroup and the mention of early elections in the week-end press affected Greek companies. OTE ( Hellenic Telecommunications Organisation SA ) saw its risk premium widen 35bps to close at 407bps and PPCGA (Public Power Corporation) saw its risk premium widen 1.75pts to close at 17.75pts upfront. These 2 names led the underperformers’ pack.
"
"Which Constituents For iTraxx Crossover?. Over the last 6 months, the performance of credit indices have been fairly impressive. Roughly speaking, risk premia have tightened by 15% during that period. But that masks a wide disparity in individual performances. As you can see on this grapple where green indicates a positive performance and red a negative one, we have very bright colours! For instance OTE ( Hellenic Telecommunications Organisation SA ) is 228bps wider @ 435bps, ABGSM (Abengoa) is 488bps wider @ 938bps while MESSA ( Metsa Board Oyj ) is 140bps tighter @ 77bps and UNILSUB (Unilabs) is 305bps tighter @ 438bps. That disparity has given headaches to people managing European index compositions. Up to series 22, to be eligible for inclusion in iTraxx Crossover, a company needed to have a risk premium in excess of twice the average risk premium of the non-financial constituents of iTraxx Main, the reference investment grade credit index. But this time around too many names would have been disqualified and finding 75 eligible names would have been a struggle. So it was decided to bend the rule and to lower the criteria from twice to 1.5 time. 
"
"Shock And Awe. Not long ago, no one would have predicted that a 2.5bps move in the German 10-year interest rate would represent a 10% move, but this is what happened today! QE only started officially on Monday, but the results have been impressive so far, and credit has been impacted like almost every single European risky asset. It is fair to say that a number of investors had anticipated the move, but the performance since the beginning of the year says it all. While CDXIG is almost unchanged at 65bps compared with 67bps on the 2nd of January, iTraxx Main has seen its risk premium tighten 12bps from 61.5bps to 49.5bps. Except during the height of the Lehman crisis, the spread between the 2 indices has hardly been that wide, even when the risk premia of banks (which are not included in the US indices) were effectively worth 0 back in 2006-2007. The same is true when you compare iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) in Europe with CDX High Yield (CDXHY) in the US. Adjusted for the defaults of RSH (Radioshack) and HET (Caesar), CDXHY is unchanged at 323bps while ITXEX is 78bps tighter at 255bps. It does not leave much room for any misstep in the handling of the Greek situation.
"
"An Energy Index?. The provisional lists of the constituents of the different credit indices are being published by Markit since the beginning of the week, both in Europe and in the US. As a reminder, the new series (S24 in the US and S23 in Europe) will begin to trade on the 20th March. There will not be many changes in the investment grade benchmark in the US (CDXIG). There should be only 4 names going out (Avon, Genworth, MDC and Safeway) and of course 4 names coming in (Apache Corp, Canadian Natural Resources, Domtar, and Enbridge). What is striking though, is that if you click on the upper right corner of the above grapple, the Energy sector, you will see 3 of the 4 newcomers. That means that the number of CDXIG constituents coming from the energy sector will jump to 12. That is roughly 10% of the total weightings. But from a spread contribution perspective, that number jumps to 32%. One should expect CDXIG24 to exhibit a much higher correlation with oil prices than previous vintages of CDXIG. Who needs an energy index?
"
"Where Are The New Entrants?. When the current series of indices were launched on October 6th, 2014, the number of constituents of iTraxx Crossover was expanded from 60 previously to 75. That followed a similar increase in March 2014 from series 20 to series 21, when iTraxx Crossover saw its population rise from 50 to 60 members. Trading on the 10 names that made it a year ago has been a success and their inclusion in the index has definitely improved their liquidity. The likes of VUECIN (Vougeot), LOUDRE (Louis Dreyfus), ABGSM (Abengoa) or ALTICE trade on a regular basis and are now part of the CDS landscape. Hence, on the above grapple where each name is depicted by a square whose size depends on the notional traded over the last 6 months, you can spot all of them. It is quite a different story for most of the new entrants into series 22. You can look as long as you wish, you will struggle to find LOXAM, CARE UK, SELNSW (Selecta Group), LINDOR (Lock Lower) or NVFVES (Novafives). The reason is simple: they hardly trade. Nevertheless it has been decided to leave them in iTraxx Crossover series 23. So, they will be given another chance, but if trading does not start in earnest on these names, one could legitimately question their inclusion in any further series and reducing the number of iTraxx Crossover constituents should seriously be considered.
"
"If You Thought It Was Over. Some old themes have come back to haunt the market recently. Currencies swings have of course been at the forefront of investors’ preoccupations and they probably go a long way in explaining the diverging paths of Euro and US risky assets. But Oil prices have also resumed their downward trajectory. They are down more than 15% since the beginning of the month, and that has not gone unnoticed in credit markets. The red colour painted all over the energy sector on the above grapple in the US is proof that it has underperformed other compartments of the credit market over the last week. While the risk premia of American companies have traded sideways across the board, the average risk premium of energy companies has increased by 10%, widening 20bps to 211.5bps. This is made all the more obvious by the size of box dedicated to this sector, which also indicates it was one of the busiest in terms of trading activity. 
"
"Did Investors Forget About The Roll?. Today’s session was fully dedicated to consolidation in the credit market. All indices are closing wider, but what is more surprising is that their theoretical risk premia increased even faster. That in itself is not very usual during the first phase of a move one way or the other, but, a couple of days before the roll, this is even more surprising. Indeed on Friday the “on-the-run” (or standard) 5 year maturity will increase by 3 months. The “new” 5 year risk premia of all companies should then roughly increase by 5% compared with the “old” one. That is a rough approximation which assumes risk premia increase linearly as a function of their maturity between 0 and 5 years and that they are worth 0 for 0 year. In fact that very rarely occurs, and risk premia hardly ever completely roll up the curve. Anything between a quarter to half of the expected widening is usually “lost”, and all shorter dated maturities will see their risk premium decrease everything being equal. Decreasing bases right before the roll is definitely not a usual pattern in the run up to the roll, at least in a rather stable market.
"
"OTE: A Barometer For The Greek Crisis. In the credit derivatives market, there are few instruments that enable to get a feeling for what investors hope or fear for Greece. OTE ( Hellenic Telecommunications Organisation SA ) is most definitely one of them though. And the picture painted by the above grapple is a bit worrying. The market gave obviously little credit to the negotiations which begun late February and risks have been rising steadily ever since. People’s nervousness has directly translated in a one way upward trajectory for OTE’s 5 year risk premium (it shot up by 40bps today’s alone), but also in substantial amount of CDS being traded. You can see at the bottom of the chart that transactions worth $73mln were reported every day in DTCC over the last week.
"
"The Week At A Glance. As you can see on the above grapple, the risk of investment grade credits in Europe has widened over the last week across the board. The red bar shows that the average widening in Europe was 2.6bps. On the left-end side are all the underperformers, and almost all the latter are to be found in 2 sectors. They are either financials or energy companies. That pretty much sums up what the market has focused on. On the one hand, a lot of attention was paid to the fall in oil prices, which is back to levels last seen 6 years ago. On the other hand, investors have grown more concerned about Greece and the absence of progress towards a resolution of their debt position over the last few weeks and they also became wary of names exposed to emerging markets in general.
"
"Want To See What A Bull Roll Looks Like?. If you ever want to see a bull roll, today was the day you were waiting for. While the kids were busy watching what was described as a “breath taking spectacle” when parts of Europe were plunge into darkness during the “best eclipse in years”, their parents were busy selling protection on almost every available name. Today was the day where standard maturities were pushed by a quarter. For instance, the 5-year maturity is now June 2020 as opposed to March 2020 until yesterday. So the least you would expect is for 5 year risk premia to increase a little to account for these extra 3 months. But as you can see, not only risk premia did not increase, but they even decrease on average. We were expecting many bright red squares, and the only bright boxes are green. Investors were selling June 2020 protection today at the same (or even at lower) levels than they were selling March 2020 protection yesterday. If you navigate across the different categories (European/American, Investment Grade/High Yield are available on the right end side of the grapple), you will get similar results which ever combination you choose. That is what we call a “bull roll”.

"Is DB's Senior Debt Still Senior?. Over the last week or so, the 5 year risk premia of financial institutions in general and banks in particular have been put under pressure by the tensions by Greece and European creditors. It has been one of the clear underperforming sectors since mid-March. In that weak environment, German banks, and more specifically DB ( Deutsche Bank AG ), were put under additional stress. Indeed, the German Finance Ministry published a draft law that would make senior unsecured debt subordinated on a statutory basis to money market debt, derivatives and other senior instruments. Even if the impact should eventually be limited, the 5 year CDS referencing the senior debt of DB experienced additional weakness.

"Equity’s Pain Can Be CDS’s Gain. FCX ( Freeport-McMoRan Inc ) announced this morning that they are cutting their dividend by more than 80%. The market was taken by surprise, as a recent rebound in the price of copper from the January lows had reassured them regarding the sector's health. That triggered heavy selling on the stock: it lost more than 3% shortly after the opening bell, even though it stabilised down 1% afterwards. But this unexpected decision will also save the company roughly $1.1bln. As the management also mentioned potential asset divestitures that were said to be off the agenda only a week ago, it will help protect FCX’s balance sheet. The credit market duly factored this positive newsflow in, and sent the 5 year risk premium of FCX 21bps tighter at 277bps.

"Heinz Puts Kraft On The Menu. Overnight 3G Capital Partners and Berkshire Hathaway have offered to merge Kraft Foods Group with HNZ (HJ Heinz Company) to create The Kraft Heinz Co. 3G and Berkshire will own 51% on the new company, while existing Kraft shareholders will get 49% and a $16.5 special dividend. Importantly for the CDS market, no new debt will be issued and the management announced that they are committed to maintaining an investment grade rating going forward. The operation is effectively removing the LBO risk which was overhanging on the food and beverage sector as 3G now appears committed (at least in the medium term). So entire complex traded better today, but the most spectacular move was seen in HNZ’s 5 year CDS which gapped 119bps to 64bps as investors expect it to be a dead box going forward.

"Welcome Aboard!. You might struggle to see all of them on this grapple, but we are pleased to announce that the universe captured by DataGrapple has now been slightly expanded: the number of entities on which prices and volumes are available has increased from 680 to 697, mainly on the back on new inclusions in the indices launched last Friday (we also slightly anticipated the launch of CDXHY series 24). In addition to the index constituents, DataGrapple still references the 500 most actively traded reference entities over the last 6 months according to DTTC. Rating changes have been factored in, and the relevant trees now reflect this of course. We also put a great amount of work on improving our clustering algorithm. Based on our 9-year-long time series, it produces all the Machine Trees which regroup statistically close entities. They should be much more stable going forward. As always comments and questions are welcome, so please get in touch with us.

"A New Basis Pattern?. Historically we have been used to seeing the on the run series of iTraxx Crossover, the hedging instrument of choice for high yield cash portfolios, trade with a positive basis. If you click on any crossover series prior to 21 on the right end side, you will get the same pattern. The basis was positive during the debut trading of the index and then progressively turned negative when it became off the run. As you can see, Series 22 offers a notably different picture. The inclusion of more yieldy names which were mostly new to the CDS market has increased the dispersion of spreads within the index. Investors have also been looking at ways to get some carry and the wider spread offered by iTraxx Crossover S22 appeared compelling given its intrinsic diversification. These two factors were undoubtedly behind the mostly negative basis that it has known since its launch in October 2014. During the course of last week, since the launch of series 23, people have unwound their long risk positions on S22 and positioned themselves on S23 which they expect to be more liquid going forward. S23 is therefore trading with a negative basis while the basis of S22 is fast approaching 0. If QE is with us for a while and continues to depress returns, that could well be the new Crossover basis pattern.
"
"Will Euro Indices Protect You Vs Greece?. Today risky assets have been rallying hard across the board. Equities were up between 1 and 2% around the globe, interest rates were lower, and credit spreads were tighter. The fair value of all European and American credit indices were tighter indeed, so it was all the more surprising to see that both iTraxx Main (ITXEB23) and iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX23) closed actually wider on the day (ITXEB23 5y closed 0.4bps wider at 56.25bps and ITXEX23 5y closed 1bp wider at 262.5bps). It looks as if these 2 instruments, which are arguably the most liquid in the credit universe, are used to hedge entire portfolios against a negative outcome in the current negotiations between Greece and their European creditors. During such a generally positive move, one would expect the bases to become more negative, but we got exactly the opposite on ITXEB23 and ITXEX23.
"
"Lufthansa Under The Cosh. Since the roll, most of the corporate names have been trading sideways. Even the recent rise in oil has not had its usual side effect on airline companies. The 5 year risk premium of BAB (British Airways Plc) is actually tighter today at 116bps than it was on March 20th (116bps) and that of AFFP (Société Air France) is unchanged at 71bps. There is one name in the sector which has been on the move in Europe though: LUFTHA (Deutsche Lufthansa) has seen its 5 year CDS charge wider after the recent tragedy during which a plane of Germanwings, its low-cost subsidiary, crashed in the French Alps. After an initially muted reaction, the 5 year CDS has widened 24bps to 126bps. The $300mln rumoured by the press to have been tagged by LUFTHA for potential claims have eventually taken their toll on the company. This trend should be backed tomorrow when DTTC publish their weekly volume statistics, and one should expect a fair amount of protection to have changed hands.
"
"Everybody Out Of The Pool!. Looking at the daily variations of credit indices on both sides of the Atlantic will give you the impression of another subdued trading session. Ahead of the long week-end, this actually what it was for most of the time. Early in the afternoon though, investors had a glimpse of what could lie in store if/when the tone escalates further between Greece and its creditors. When news hit the tape that Athens would not repay an IMF loan due on April 9th if lenders failed to send them further funds, iTraxx Main gapped 2bps from 55.5bps to 57.5bps and iTraxx Crossover gapped from 259bps to 265bps in the blink of an eye. This was swiftly denied by the Greek government and indices subsequently retraced a good portion of this panicky move. Nevertheless we have been warned of the potential effects of the combination of the likely thin liquidity around the Easter break and the unpredictable newsflow.
"
"When It Moves, It Trades. For a while, OLN ( Olin Corporation ) had gone off the radar in creditland as the level of its 5 year risk premium had been fairly stable since last October’s roll. Nevertheless when its good February run came to an end, its CDS daily volumes increased to 25M$. Since early March, OLN’s risk premium was moving up steadily as the pace of the US economy has started to be questioned, but on the 27th March, DOW ( Dow Chemical Co ) announced a $5bln reverse Morris Trust transaction with OLN, whereby a new entity will be created into which DOW’s chloro alkali assets will be dropped and then merged with OLN. The new company will be a global industry leader with $7bln in revenues and $1bln in EBITDA. OLN’s CDS came crashing down 65bps to 130bps before eventually stabilising around 150bps, the level analysts had been anticipating at the time the operation was announced. In the process, volumes shot up $44mln per day. When it moves, it trades!
"
"Has FX delivered FedEx A Bargain?. FedEx ( FedEx Corporation ) announced overnight their intention to take over  TNT Express NV  for €4.4bln. If it proves successful, this €8 per share offer will be less expensive in dollar terms than the failed bid of UPS ( United Parcel Service, Inc ) when they offered to pay €9.5 in 2013 for the same company. Only time will tell whether it will be a bargain in the long run, as TNT’s management stated a month ago that 2015 would be a “challenging year of transition”. But recent FX moves are undoubtedly presenting US corporates with acquisition opportunities in Europe. Undisputable winners of the deal are PNLNA’s ( PostNL NV ) debt holders though. PNLNA’s 14.7% stake in TNT should earn them €642m, which they said would be earmarked for debt reduction. That should translate into a material deleveraging, and the management should be in a position to achieve their target of a high BBB rating with both S&P; and Moody’s. The market duly acknowledged and send PNLNA’s 5 year risk premium 9bps tighter at 60bps.
"
"Are Bases The Perfect Hedge?. Quantitative easing has created a low yield environment hardly ever seen before. The action of the ECB since the beginning of March has almost sent interest rates to 0 up to the 5 year point all around Europe. An unprecedented number of corporate bonds with maturity up to 5 year now yield less than 1%. It is no surprise then to see these corporates flood the market with record high amounts of bonds. In March alone, according to Bloomberg, excluding Governments and Financial institutions, €400bln were issued. So much so, that while European government bonds are mopped up by the ECB, corporate credit spread have stopped rallying. That definitely raises the question of the ability of credit funds to withstand any marked to market loss or cope with any sizeable redemption. Less than half the bonds issued have a traded CDS. That means investors will not be able to turn to the single name market to mitigate their risks. They will have to rely on macro hedges, like credit indices and particularly iTraxx Crossover which best fits this universe of non-tradable names. If there is any blip in the market, on the back on this likely reach for index protection, you can be sure it will directly impact index bases, which will turn positive very rapidly. And, as you can see on the above grapple, iTraxx Crossover’s basis has been stubbornly negative over the last month. If you can buy this basis, you will get an efficient hedge that will not cost you a penny. 
"
"Will CDXIG And iTraxx Main Disconnect?. Today was a fairly lacklustre session as the release of the FOMC minutes failed to have a lasting impact on the market. That said, central banks’ action are still at the forefront of investors’ preoccupations. The diverging paths of the FED and the ECB was behind today’s underperformance of CDXIG against iTraxx Main (ITXEB). Indeed, that was one of the main reasons why people decided to take advantage of the recent tightening of CDXIG relative to ITXEB, and decided to put on so-called “decompression trades”. A longer dated analysis is somewhat biased by the March roll (the risk premium differential between CDXIG523 and CDXIG524 stands at 0.375bps while it is worth 6bps between ITXEB522 and ITXEB523), but the spread between CDXIG524 and ITXEB523, which traded at 9bps at the end of March, was worth 4.3bps yesterday at the close. In a market which is currently short of conviction, that was enough to trigger some relative value trading.
"
"No One Is Too Big To Move. General Electric (GE) announced overnight that they are selling off the majority of GECC (General Electric Capital Corporation) assets. These assets are sold mostly to Blackstone, and some loans to Wells Fargo. This came as a surprise to the market, and GECC’s risk premium, which had been relatively stable recently, was marked aggressively tighter, down 19bps to 41bps. The move is seen as a positive for GECC, as it is now guaranteed by a blue chip industrial company which will focus going forward on the businesses it has always done well. It will be a cleaner name once GECC assets are sold off. And the market was quick to note that GE will guarantee all tradable senior and subordinated debt issued by GECC. On top of that, GE does not expect to issue incremental GECC long term debt for at least 5 years.
"
"Is Confidence In US Credits Waning?. If you look at the above grapple, you will see that the basis of iTraxx Main (ITXEB) in Europe has been consistently more positive (or less negative depending on the period) than the basis of CDX IG in the US. You will get the same picture irrespective of the timespan you select and certainly over the last 3 years. Because of the unwavering commitment of the FED to provide unlimited liquidity, CDXIG was seen as a safe haven whenever investors were looking for a source of carry, creating a consistent supply of CDXIG protection, hence the persistent negative basis. Because of the sovereign crisis in Europe, investors have never felt entirely comfortable with European credits and were quick to buy ITXEB protection as a macro hedge for the European part of their portfolio, providing a deep bid for ITXEB protection, hence the persistent positive basis. But over the last few months, the ECB has started their QE operation and the FED is exiting theirs. Guess what? The two lines just crossed each other, and it would not be surprising that the basis of CDXIG trades on top of ITXEB’s for a while going forward
"
"Is It The Wind Of Change?. This morning we saw more stories of potential M&A; in the TMT sector. There have been articles out regarding NOKIA ( Nokia Oyj ) potentially buying ALUFP ( Alcatel Lucent SA ). Previously stories were based around NOKIA buying some parts of the business, but the talks now seem to be of a complete purchase. And the most surprising bit is the attitude of the French government, which in the past has been notorious for blocking takeovers of its so-called industrial jewels. Well, not this time. Intense competition from Chinese telecommunication-equipment makers like Huawei and ZTE appears to have brought a “whiff of pragmatism to the corridors of power” as some columnists put it. Over the last nine months, the French government has actually been facilitating the deal, taking part in the talks between NOKIA and ALUFP, and de facto acknowledging that ALUFP would face an uphill battle to survive as a stand-alone company in a brutal market.
"
"Words and Confetti. The attached grapple shows how unmoved the CDS market has been today. We could have reacted to words and confetti. First, we had harsh words from Wolfgang Schaeuble saying Greece was a “bottomless pit”. Second, we had Josephine Witt, the activist sending confetti on Mario Draghi.  ECB is not really popular among Europeans. The market was unmoved, little activity on the CDS has to be reported.  

On the index side, we had the option expiry. Due to the large base of gamma sellers, the volatility was contained.   The iTraxx Europe Series 23 has been trading in a 2bps range for the last 3 weeks. We are definitively on an inflection point with a growing asymmetry in favour of a large consolidation. 

"
"It Is All About Greece. After a few fairly muted sessions (even yesterday’s option expiry only saw subdued trading activity and low volatility), things started hotting up today. Greece was front and center. Even though it was denied by the Greek officials, Greece was said to have informally inquired about the consequences of a missed payment on their obligations towards the IMF. These rumours made investors uncomfortable and risky assets declined across the board. Credit was no exception and the the 55bps and 260bps levels which had recently capped every widening move on iTraxx Main and iTraxx Crossover respectively were taken out. A default would not necessarily presage a rapid euro exit, but capital controls would likely be imposed. Unsurprisingly, financial institutions underperformed other compartments of the market.
"
"Weird And Weak. Today was a weird trading session. It begun with a blackout of all Bloomberg terminals which lasted almost all morning and put trading on CDS to a halt. Then around noon all risky assets nosedived without any one able to provide really convincing explanation. When it happened everyone thought Greece, but no new news was available on this front, and people were left with a tightening in trading rules by the Chinese regulators which sent Chinese equity futures tumbling as the only plausible cause. In any case, the last 2 sessions have rocked investors’ boat and even if there was no panic, hedges were put in place, and as is customary in the world of credit, indices were bought “en masse”. That caused a fierce move wider of all the liquid indices, while single names were not the primary focus today. They will play catch up next week, but the obvious result today was bases trading firmly in positive territory across the board. Even the iTraxx Crossover index, which, over the last 6 months, had developed a habit of trading at a tighter risk premium than its theoretical value, joined the positive basis crowd.
"
"The Ghosts Constituents Of Crossover. iTraxx Crossover Series 22 was launched in October 2014. It has been traded for a bit more than 6 months. When it was decided to expand the number of its constituents to 75 compared with the previous series 60, the idea was to bring liquidity to CDS referencing companies dealers were less (or not at all) used to trading.  It was supposed to help kick start the European CDS High Yield market. The experiment was anything but a success when the composition of series 23 was decided, as all of the new entrants were still trading by appointment only.  Nevertheless, the list was left intact, and all were included in iTraxx Crossover series 23. The situation is not getting any better, and some of the riskier entities (like PPCGA, the Greek utility) have actually stopped trading. You can stare at the above grapple as long as you want, you will not find PPCGA, LOXAM, CAREUK, ISOLUX, HEMA or DRYMIX. They have simply gone off traders’ radar screen. The liquidity of the iTraxx Crossover index has not been impacted yet, but, in any move (and we have seen that recently), its basis (ie the difference between an index quoted level and its theoretical level) will be all over the place.
"
"Greece, Front And Center. Over the last few sessions, credit indices have underperformed pretty much everything else: equities, cash and CDS (index bases experienced a shift into positive territory recently). But among indices, iTraxx Main (ITXEB) and iTraxx Financials (ITXES) have been the clear underperformers. The explanation lies squarely with the stalemate in the negotiations between Greece and their European creditors. There are no Greeks names in ITXEB or ITXES, but investors know that European banks would be severely impacted by a Greek default, and they are largely represented in both indices.  That is why the risk premium difference between ITXEB and ITXES is back to the wides. That is why the risk premium of iTraxx Crossover has compressed with ITXEB on a beta adjusted basis. That is why ITXEB is now back to trading flat to CVDXIG, its US equivalent, while it was 8bps tighter only a week ago.
"
"Clients’ Positionning. Even if today’s session eventually panned out to be a bit different on the back of a late rally during European markets’ last hour of trading, credit - and more precisely credit indices - have largely underperformed other asset classes recently. Last week, while the Eurostoxx was down 1.4%, iTraxx Main widened by 9bps, from 53bps to 62bps. This underperformance is consistent with the statistics released this morning by DTCC. Together with the traded volumes which feed our different grapples on a weekly basis, they also publish the aggregated open positions of clients and dealers. It was then possible to see among investors a sharp reduction of long risk positions (or an increase in short risk positions depending on the index) in all iTraxx S23 indices between the 13th and the 17th of April. On the back of the uncertainty surrounding Greece, investors reduced their exposure on iTraxx Main by $6.7bln. They are still long risk for a hefty $17bln though, so we might have more of this underperformance phase going into May.
"
"TWC: Just The End Or A New Beginning?. Slightly more than a year ago, CMCSA ( Comcast Corporation ) announced their intention to take over TWC ( Time Warner Cable Inc ) in a $45bln mega deal. This was dealt a first blow last week, as press reports suggested that lawyers at Justice Department’s antitrust division were leaning against the proposed take-over and were preparing to launch a lawsuit to block the transaction. The killer punch might have come today, as the Wall Street Journal reported that the FCC does not think the combination is in the public interest and could recommend a hearing on the case. Many think that would effectively kill the deal, which in turn may result in other M&A; transactions unravelling (Charter’s $10.4bln acquisition of Bright House is contingent on the CMCSA/TWC deal going through). Another M&A; phase would almost certainly begins, which might see TWC turn from hunted to hunter. On the back of the current uncertainty, TWC’s risk premium doubled in a week, up 70bps to 134bps in hefty volumes (more than $50mln per day).
"
"We Will Be All Right. The market has been nervous over the last few weeks, as a resolution of the standoff between Greece and its creditors does not seem any closer than a fortnight ago. This lack of progress fuelled the underperformance of European credits compared with their US counterparts. European Financial entities were put under particular pressure, and they formed the worst performing group.  In the above grapple, they are the red pins. But if it obvious that all the heads point right indicating a widening of the risk premia over the last month across the board, they also point up. That means that short dated risk premia have not moved faster than 5 year risk premia. When credit curves flatten in a widening environment, it is a sign of stress. It is clearly not the case at the moment, even on the most exposed compartment of the credit market. So far, everyone seems to consider that a few bumps may lie ahead, but that, in the end, everything will be all right.
"
"Is PORTEL Really A Real Play?. Since the beginning of March, PORTEL (Portugal Telecom) has massively underperformed the market. Because the debt of the company is guaranteed by Oi SA, the company offering fixed-line and mobile telecommunications services in Brazil, it has been used as a proxy for emerging risks in South America and particularly as a play on the Real weakness. But technicals can complicate the picture in CDS. Most of the euro denominated bonds issued by PORTEL are trading at positive basis compared with the CDS and seem to be pricing in an early redemption. As Oi’s dollar bonds do not appear to be deliverable into the CDS (a succession event is deemed unlikely by analysts), if the early redemption thesis is confirmed, PORTEL’s CDS will be orphan with no deliverable debt. That could well explain the 40bps tightening that took place over the last two trading sessions.
"
"What Moves With What?. In DataGrapple, the CDS Treemap Machine Tree presents data which grouped by statistical clusters. It groups together entities which have been historically close from a statistical point of view over a long period of time. It is quite striking to see that it is most of time reasonably easy to stick a name on a given cluster. Most associations make sense intuitively, and groups composed over long period of time still exhibit strong correlation over shorter periods. For instance, the brightest tones of red (which in this case means these are names which have seen their risk premia widen over the last week) are all concentrated on the right end side of the grapple, in 2 groups which have both been impacted by the poor statistics released last week regarding new home sales: home builders and monolines. 
"
"The Return Of Volatility. It might not strike you when you look at the daily changes of the different indices, but the session was incredibly volatile. The end result is some decompression in Europe between iTraxx Main (ITXEB) and iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) on the one hand, and some outperformance of ITXEB compared with CDX IG in the US. That does not tell the whole story though. If ITXEX is closing almost unchanged at 272.5bps (it is 1bp tighter on the day), its total variation (ie the sum of the successive moves wider and tighter during the day) was well in excess of 50bps. All that happened while very little new news was reaching the market and the prices’ moves appear to be due mainly to the thin liquidity. It is a theme which has been discussed at length recently on different asset classes, and credit is no exception, particularly ahead of a long week-end.
"
"Sell In May…. After a couple of sessions that were done with a good portion of market participants enjoying some time off, trading for the month of May started in earnest today. It all began slowly, but from noon onwards, credit indices started to drift wider. And they did so at a decent pace. The reason is to be found in the interest rates reversal which began last week, and of course in the Greek situation which produced more noise today. It came in the form of a rumour that the IMF would require some debt reduction before granting further money. With deadlines drawing ever closer for Greece, investors now strongly feel like a day without any progress is a day lost and they are becoming a bit agitated. That put the UK elections on the side-lines for now, but they could prompt a few wobble of their own later in the week. Because of all that, investors would be foolish to go away, but they certainly had good reasons to start selling in May.
"
"Back To Normal. Over the last month, risk premia trended gently wider in the US (CDXIG went from 60bps to 64.75bps and CDXHY went from 329bps to 346bps), while the ride was a bit wilder in Europe (iTraxx Main – ITXEB - went from 56bps to 63bps and iTraxx Crossover went from 254bps to 286bps) as Greece created some additional noise. The underperformance of the European credit indices can be almost entirely explained by a move in the bases. In Europe, they are now all back in positive territory, which means that the risk premia of the various European indices are wider than their theoretical values computed using the risk premia of their constituents. Based on history, it is the most common configuration, especially for ITXEX. The recent episode of volatility has brought the whole basis complex where it belongs.
"
"A feeling Of Déjà Vu. The correlation between all risky assets during the session was impressive. Equities, interest rates, FX and credit moved in unison, and they all hit their most stressed levels mid-morning when German 10y rate reached 0.77%. The remaining part of the session was spent erasing the whole move, and most markets ended the day almost where they left it yesterday at the close. iTraxx Main (resp. iTraxx Crossover) opened at 64bps (resp 290bps), went all the way to 67bps (resp 303bps) as long risk positions were cut, before coming back to close at 62.2bps (resp 283bps) as short risk positions were unwound to close 0.8bps (resp 3bps) tighter on the day. In the end, it was a tricky session if you are managing short gamma positions, but if you are a medium term investor who does not spend his time staring at his screens watching markets’ every move, you could be forgiven for wondering what the fuss was all about. We already had a few instances of these intraday moves eventually petering out and the current volatile environment will certainly bring some more.
"
"LADLN (Ladbrokes): A Losing Bet. The results of the UK general election were eventually out this morning. They gave the Tory a comfortable win and an outright majority in the House of Commons. This came as a surprise for anyone who has followed the most recent polls released by YouGov et al, which predicted a very close outcome. Apparently gamblers fared much better, and Mr Cameron has been the gamblers’ favourite to win as far back as February according to a Bloomberg article. They also did better than investors, who seemed to have been taken by surprise by Mr Cameron’s victory and had positioned themselves defensively on a number of companies that would have suffered from a Labour government. For instance, LADLN ( Ladbrokes Plc ), despite having to pay out £2mln on bets placed on a positive outcome for the Conservatives, saw its share climb 9% and its 5-year-risk premium collapse 42.5bps to 286.5bps as short risk positions were trimmed. The company has a large exposure to fixed-odds betting terminals, and Labour’s pledge to crack down on them would have been a serious blow.
"
"A Window On Asia. In our daily blog, most of the focus is on American or European companies. But while at the moment you will only find European and US credit indices, Datagrapple publishes information on the 500 most liquid entities according to DTTC and also the constituents of some Asian indices. If your favourite pick (or your biggest exposure) is an Asian name, you should definitely have a go and see whether it is included in Datagrapple’s universe. For instance, on the above grapple, you can see than TOSH’s ( Toshiba Corp ) $2.8bln drop in market capitalisation today triggered by withdrawal of their earnings forecast pending an internal probe into improper accounting on infrastructure projects was matched by a 55bps surge of its 5 year risk premium to 125bps. 
"
"Credit And Politics. As far as credit is concerned, despite some volatility, last week has not brought any major change. Utilities for instance were stable as a whole in Europe (you can see that the green candle is actually flat), but, within the sector, performance has varied greatly. Indeed, political issues have come back to the forefront in various countries, with a strong impact on a few names. In the UK, all eyes were on the outcome of the general election. With the election of a Conservative government, UK utilities reacted positively: the proposed power price freeze by the Labour Party leader had unsettled investors during the run-up to the poll. CENTRI’s ( Centrica Plc ) and UU’s ( United Utilities Group Plc ) 5 year risk premia tightened 6.5bps to 66bps and 1.5bps to 86.5bps respectively. At the other end of the spectrum, the never ending Greece saga continues and growing fears over the future of the country’s debt clearly did not help peripheral players. ELEPOR ( EDP - Energias De Portugal SA ) was the worst performer of the sector, and its 5 year CDS widened by 4bps to 133.5bps.
"
"Italian Wireless Market: Wind Of Change. It was a quiet day across the board, and most names finished the day tighter. Indeed, credit indices opened tighter and spent the session in very tight ranges, except for their late spike wider which brought them unchanged compared with yesterday’s close during the last hour of trading. That did not leave enough time for single names to follow suit and catch a bid. The trading activity was subdued except for a few names. WINDIM (Wind) topped the list in terms of flow. The market eventually got the confirmation of the rumour that triggered yesterday’s 30bps tightening of its risk premium. Vimplecom’s CEO confirmed today that the company is in talks with Hutchison Whampoa to combine their mobile phone business in Italy. The 50-50 joint venture will form the country’s largest wireless operator by customers (with more than 30 million of them), combining WINDIM and 3 Italia. Italy was the last European telecommunications market not to have experienced consolidation.
"
"EU Tariffs. With part of Europe closed for Ascension Day, no one really expected a bumper day in terms of activity. Volumes were effectively on the low side, and they were exchanged in a very well behaved environment. With interest rates taking a breather, credit indices took the whole to cancel yesterday’s late spike. So, on the market as a whole, the general move was fairly benign and gave investors little clue on how to trade single name CDS. It did not mean that nothing happened though. Metal companies for instance were notable outperformers. The EU is examining whether exporters of certain products sell them in the 28-nation bloc below cost, and an investigation into cold-rolled products of iron and non-alloy steel is under way. That gave MTNA  ( ArcelorMittal SA ) a boost, as tariffs were imposed yesterday on a number of products coming from the US, China, Russia, Japan and North Korea. Its shares closed up more than 6% and its 5-year risk premium tightened 10bps to 270bps.

"Some CDS Can Go Wider!. Permira and Apax have decided to cash on their investment in NELOOK (New Look) the UK company that sells women’s clothing. It has long been in the cards, but so far, the preferred route seemed to be an IPO, and rumours that it was to happen imminently sent the NELOOK’s 5-year risk premium from the 250-300bps where it belonged to 200bps back in February. It was confirmed yesterday that the business will eventually be sold to Brait, the investment company of Christo Wiese, the South African billionaire. NELOOK’s bonds have change of control provisions, so investors who own them will be offered a way out whatever. The prospects for the CDS is a little more difficult to call. NELOOK said that current debt will remain in place for now and that the company will review financing alternatives in order to optimize the capital structure within the same leverage range. Brait is essentially a private equity vehicle, so they could push additional debt into NELOOK, which would inevitably send the CDS wider. Or they could set up a new finance company and replace existing debt with new bonds, which would raise the prospect of orphaning for the CDS referencing the current NELOOK and send it much tighter. Alternatively they could simply replace whichever amount of bonds will get put to the company by investors and use another financing vehicle to pay for the acquisition, which would leave the CDS unaffected. As a precaution, while they wait for more clarity, investors sent NELOOK’s 5-year CDS to its pre IPO rumours level.
"
"Is It This Dull?. The interest rate market was much quieter today, and the credit market had to look elsewhere for direction. So, surprise, surprise, it turned to… Greece! As no material progress had been made during the week-end, the tone was defensive throughout most of the session, and European indices saw their risk premia increase across the board, even though the move was not very aggressive. Eventually, most of the widening was erased in the second part of the afternoon, when the rumour had that the EU was willing to compromise for a Greek deal, and that €5bln could be released rapidly once lowered primary surplus requirements would be agreed. As it turned out, the story was actually coming from a Greek newspaper, and a spokesman for the EU said they were not aware of the plan. The market is really feeding on scraps at the moment, and the moves are tamed, as shown be the alarmingly pale colors of the above grapple.
"
"Option Pins. It felt like a fairly active day on most asset classes. They were buoyed by Mr Coeuré’s speech in London yesterday, during which he said that the ECB is moderately frontloading its bond purchases in May and June to try and avoid the summer lull which traditionally affects markets in July and August. FX, rates and equities were all impacted in Europe. Credit joined the party, but to a lesser extent. iTraxx Main (ITXEB) underperformed and struggled to break the 60bps level. iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) did not massively compressed much either and was very sticky as soon as the 275bps level was broken. The fact that the Greek saga has still not reached a conclusion certainly did not help as credit indices are seen by many as a relatively cheap hedge against a negative outcome. But it can also be explained by the option expiry, which takes place tomorrow like every third Wednesday on each month. The dealer community, which is the more likely to run delta hedged portfolios appear to have accumulated chunky positions of the 60 strike on ITXEB and of the 275 strike on ITXEX. Unless we gap tomorrow at the open, the market could be very sticky around these levels until 4pm UK Time, which marks the May option exercise deadline.
"
"It Is All Happening In The TMT Sector. As expected, on the day of expiry of credit index options, large gamma positive positions made for tight trading ranges on iTraxx Main, iTraxx Crossover and CDXIG. But it did not mean that the market was dead, and actually some parts were actively traded. The TMT sector for instance saw plenty of news and plenty of activity. There were confirmed news like the acquisition of Suddenlink, the US cable operator, by ALTICE in a deal valued at $8bln. They will issue $1.7bln of new debt and target a 5x leverage in the short to medium term. There was also speculation that they are interested as well in TWC. This combo sent ALTICE’s 5 year risk premium 17bps wider at 371bps (that of NUMFP – Numericable – duly followed suit). Of course, there was also the declarations of Mr Malone who said Vodafone would be a great fit for Liberty and that a combination would be the “promise of creating enormous shareholder value if we could work it out”. That sent the Liberty complex on the move with IESYRP (Unity Media) and VMED (Virgin Media) both 10bps tighter at 164bps and 181bps respectively, while VOD (Vodafone) was 9.5bps wider at 78bps.
"
"Should We Brace Ourselves For A Squeeze?. The day begun in a very similar fashion to yesterday, and despite heavy action in the credit index option space, the different indices hardly moved at all. Their fair values stayed in a very narrow range as well. But while the single names kept on trading in a similar fashion during the afternoon (the fair value of iTraxx Main closed the day unchanged at 61.2bps and the fair value of iTraxx Crossover closed 0.5bps tighter @ 281.9bps), credit indices started to move tighter in unison during the last 3 hours, pushing bases into negative territory. Bases are at their most negative in a month (the index risk premia are tighter than their theoretical value computed using their constituents) and that could signal a change in investors’ perception of the European risk… at least in the near future.
"
"Grohe : opening the CDS tap?. Grohe CDS is an ""orphan"" CDS. There is no public debt to deliver into the CDS. Most credit traders were familiar with the credit story. The CDS was in Xover Series 3 to 19.  Late in 2013,  Lixil Group Corp   bought the company and replaced Grohe public financing with company financing.  Grohe was left without public debt. Over the last year, the CDS has traded sporadically.  Legacy positions or off-the-run iTraxx basis were the only sources of trading.  The CDS residual value was the out-of-money option of an unlikely refinancing at Grohe level and any bank debt if deliverable into the CDS.  Grohe bought Joyou a Chinese manufacturer in 2011. Due to a fraud made public yesterday, Joyau shall apply for insolvency.  As a consequence, the CDS is in unchartered territory. The CDS widen by 200bps with any reported trade. To which extend the fraud could weight on the complex company structure? To which extend the shareholders are liable for their lack of diligence. The case is open and we can expect that investors should clear their risks on Grohe rather than speculating on any outcome. We expect some liquidity on Grohe’s tap, however not like in the good old days.
"
"Greece’s Ups And Downs. The ups and downs of the relationships between Greece and their creditors can easily be followed by tracking the spread between iTraxx Main (ITXEB) in Europe and CDXIG in the US. They are both benchmarks for investment grade credits in their region, but ITXEB is the only one to include banks. That explains why ITXEB is often used as a quick way to hedge a portfolio against a Grexit. Since last fall, CDXIG’s risk premium trades wider than ITXEB’s, but whenever risks of an accident are rising, investors are bidding up protection on ITXEB narrowing the gap between the two. The not very reassuring news flow over the week-end has brought Greece back into the spotlight. While CDXIG was almost unchanged at 64.5bps today, ITXEB was more than 2bps wider at 63.25bps.
"
"Can I Join The Party?. If you are an investment banker, you want to manage a portfolio of clients in the TMT sector. Over the last few weeks, a raft of deals have been announced or rumoured. Most recently TWC (time Warner) was at the center of a cable mega merger with Charter, ALTICE confirmed the acquisition of Suddenlink, and VOD (Vodafone) was heavily linked with Liberty on the back on John Malone’s declarations saying what a good fit these companies are. Today, in what many see as a reaction to the tie up of ALUFP (Alcatel) and NOKIA, LMETEL (Ericsson) qlso positioned themselves: Their management said they are open to bigger M&A; deals in order to remain competitive in the market. Investors’ reaction was pretty swift, and they pushed LMETEL’s risk premium, which is usually very well behaved, 4bps wider at 56.5bps.
"
"Compression? Decompression?. It seems that the market cannot get bored with the Greek saga. Every day brings its lot of headlines and every day the market reacts. Yesterday market participants left their office hopeful that a resolution was in sight, only to be told today that Greece and their creditors are still far apart on debt talks. Directional positions have been volatile, but so have been relative value strategies. One of the market favourite plays is iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) vs iTraxx Main (ITXEB). As ITXEB includes 21 banks which will arguably be the biggest victims in a Grexit scenario, a position where you buy protection on ITXEB and sell protection on ITXEX (be careful in choosing the correct ratio though…) has been marketed as a way to protect yourself against such a scenario. And it worked today as the widely used 5x ratio produced the desired outcome. But that was also due in no mean part to the fierce tightening of CAREUK following their results, which can hardly be linked with Greece. One should also notes that ITXEX includes Greek credits (OTE and PPCGA) when ITXEB does not, and it also counts the most sensitive peripheral names among its constituents. That probably goes a long way in explaining why yesterday ITXEX tightened faster than ITXEB in a positive environment for Greek risk. The compression/decompression mechanism between ITXEX and ITXEB is a tough nut to crack.
"
"Will They? Or Won’t They?. Sometimes markets make you sound like a broken record. The week that just ended could be easily summed up: will they or won’t they? Whether Greece will be able to come up with the money to pay the IMF on the 5th June drove every single move of the credit market. We ended on a fairly weak note as the rhetoric from the European creditors of Greece have grown more cautious as the week wore on. Unsurprisingly Greek officials kept repeating that a positive outcome is close, but no one would expect anything else ahead of a long week-end, during which history tells us that tough decisions tend to be made. But the fact that the market remained relatively well behaved is most likely due to the defensive positioning of investors which have been using credit indices as a macro hedge. DTCC statistics released on Wednesday showed that the net short risk positions on iTraxx Financials Senior among clients were at their highest since May 2014. They were happy to take some chips off the table and as soon as the recent wides were reached, profit takers were there to cap moves. Otherwise, it would be difficult to explain why iTraxx Financials outperformed iTraxx Main during a week where the investment grade benchmark widened by 4bps to 65.25bps driven by worries about Greece.
"
"Greece Is In Europe… Still. The mood was cautious today after a week-end which did not bring Greece and their European creditors any closer to a resolution of the current crisis. Credit, which closed wider across the board in Europe, was much more defensive than stocks, which managed to close higher on the day. European credit indices were much more defensive than US credit indices, and both iTraxx Main (ITXEB) and iTraxx Crossover were much more defensive than their respective constituents. We have highlighted recently that ITXEB has underperformed CDXIG. That continued today with ITXEB closing at 67.5bps, 3.75bps wider than CDXIG at 63.75bps. Since this trend really took off 10 days ago, more than half (25cts or 5bps) can be explained by a change in bases. While the basis of CDXIG is going back to -20cts where it belongs for the on the run series, the basis of ITXEB is back in positive territory. If peripherals and financial names have been impacted to some degree by the Greek induced nervousness, the bulk of the bearish views have been expressed using indices.
"
"I Want To Go To Brazil. Macro considerations are still driving most of the trading. The story of the day was the 17bps jump in European interest rates. So plummeting Bunds were back on the radar screen along with Greek concerns, regarding which we await comments following new proposals each side allegedly made to the other during the last 24 hours. Understandably, trading on single name reference entities is scarcer, but there are still pockets of activity. Today for instance, telcos provided some animation. SBC ( AT&T; Inc. ), whose 5 year CDS is worth 69bps, were said to seek to establish a foothold in Brazil. As the only way to get a piece of the action is to buy an existing operator, firms with Brazilian assets were brought into play. Despite the speculative nature of the information at this stage, PORTEL’s 5 year risk premium traded 36.5bps tighter at 431bps and TITIM’s ( Telecom Italia Spa ) traded 7bps tighter at 147bps.
"
"Can CDXHY Keep Outperforming?. After a bumpy couple of months towards the end of last year of the beginning of this, it has been one way traffic on CDXHY, the benchmark for US high yield corporates. The risk premium for the 5 year point of the series 23 (December 2019 maturity) has gone from 390bps in January to 290bps currently in a straight line. The six month slide due to the shorter effective maturity is worth 20bps. So, even factoring that in, we are still talking about a meaningful tightening. Over the same period, CDXIG23, the equivalent benchmark for investment grade credits, has been stable. The compression over the last 6 months have been impressive to say the least, and appetite for yield seems intact as evidenced by the latest DTCC statistics which saw that clients have increased their long risk positions on CDXHY series 24 by $800mln last week alone. But a couple of days ago, the ISDA Determination Committee has concluded that FST (Sabine Oil & Gas Corporation) effectively defaulted. It means that it will come out of the CDXHY index in a few days. Mechanically, once the riskiest component of the index will go, the risk premium of the index, which is roughly the average of the risk premia of its constituents, will tighten substantially, by around 18bps in this case for CDXHY series 24. Then, the recent compression will be even more obvious for all to see. 
"
"Wider And Steeper. Macro considerations have played a major role recently and they have dictated the way markets have moved. The Greece never-ending soap and interest rates fierce moves have captured investors’ attention and overshadowed everything else. Nevertheless, some technicals are hard to shake off in the credit market. Risk premia have widened across the board over the last month (you can the pins are pointing right on the above grapple) and that went hand in hand with some steepening of the CDS curve (pins are mainly pointing up). Indeed when dealers increase a 5 year risk premium by 10% for instance, they tend to apply the same multiplier on all the points of the curve. This was duly recognized by the credit indices, and particularly by iTraxx Main which has steepened by almost 5bps during the last month. Furthermore in a fortnight, the single name roll will take place and it traditionally leads to some index curve steepening. Whatever the next move of the market, one should expect even steeper index curves at the end of June.
"
"Who Needs Greece To Spice Things Up?. Recently most of the volatility has been induced by Greece related pieces of news, and of course interest rates. But some parts of the market have been experiencing roller coaster rides of their own. TMT has been a fertile ground for M&A; since the beginning of the year, and this looks set to continue. At the moment, much of the focus in that sector is going to Liberty and VOD ( Vodafone Group Plc ). The latter, whose risk premium is usually well behaved, have experienced wild swings since mid-May. Mr Malone first said then that Liberty and Vodafone would be a great fit. Today, VOD confirms that talks between the two companies are taking place, and that they are in the early stage of discussions regarding a possible exchange of selected assets. Importantly, VOD stated that they are not in discussion with Liberty Global concerning a combination of the two companies. That possibility was the main reason behind the aggressive widening of VOD’s 5 year risk premium. This announcement came as a relief to investors and they marked down VOD’s 5 year CDS accordingly, sending it 8bps tighter at 78bps.
"
"Desperate For Alpha? Look Over Here. Today was undoubtedly a weak a session. Credit indices felt bid throughout the day and their march wider was only slowed by the constant threat of index-arbitrage lists being printed. But on a micro level, it felt somewhat different. Indeed, most of the credits were well behaved and most of them actually hardly moved at all. If you take the example of the High Yield universe in Europe, you can see on the above grapple that the vast majority of the names experienced little variations. But that was more than compensated for by a few outsized moves. A few names were tighter, with NELOOK (New Look) the clear outlier as the company announced it aims to refinance its whole financial debt with senior secured and senior unsecured bonds, sending its 5-year CDS almost 145bps tighter at 155bps. Much more were wider, but here again there were some outliers: HEMABV (Hema BondCo) +57bps, QUIBB (Financiere Quick) +108bps and MTNLN (Matalan Finance Plc) +51bps. If MTNLN had the excuse of publishing soft numbers that highlighted the challenges around their new distribution centers, QUIBB’s move seemed to be mainly down to bad positioning and illiquidity.
"
"And Then They Were Gone. Greece and interest rates have grabbed all the headlines recently. Over the last month, they have been the main drivers of the market moves. Even though there were pockets of activity on single name credits, the bulk of the trading took place on indices, allowing investors to be hedged and wedged with the never ending stream of contradicting pieces of news regarding Greece. On indices, the vast majority of trades was actually done on the “on the run” series of iTraxx Main, iTraxx Crossover or iTraxx Financials. The activity on “off the run” has ground to a halt, leading to the unusual situation where all the index bases are roughly the same when expressed in bps. You can see on the above Grapple that the points corresponding to the current situation are pretty much aligned, when they were not a month ago when every index was still living its own (almost) independent life. That is great if you are a basis relative value player as convergence as fully played out. Divergence will certainly reappear when normal service resume in the market (ie when the Greek psycho drama ends) though. To go from one distorted situation to another, you need to go through a more homogenous phase. That is the index basis equivalent of the Intermediate Value Theorem in mathematics.
"
"Staggered!. Since the end of last week, the tone got more acrimonious between Greece and their creditors. Investors duly took note of the change in rhetoric and cut their credit index long risk positions across the board as shown by the statistics published by DTCC (-$4bln on iTraxx Main; -$2.9bln on iTraxx Crossover). That translated into a drift wider on the indices, and today was no exception. Well, until the beginning of the afternoon, because once the rumour had it that Germany would be ready to offer Greece a staggered deal aid, the market was left… staggered. There was an aggressive phase of short covering, and credit indices were left much tighter. The bulk of the move (between 65% and 75%) was down to changes in bases though. As we have seen many times before, single names will wait until tomorrow before playing catch up, just in case some form of denial comes from Europe overnight and dampens this early enthusiasm.
"
"Fatigue Is Setting In. It was another day dominated by Greece related headlines. The positive impetus from yesterday afternoon carried into the morning session, during which the tone was constructive. But then in the afternoon, we had news that the IMF still has major differences with Greece in most key areas. That sent iTraxx Main 2.5bps wider from the tights of the day to 67bps and iTraxx Crossover 12bps wider to 300bps. While indices are bouncing around, there are obvious signs of fatigue setting in among single name credits. Variations are contained across the board as shown by the pale shades of green and red that you can see on the above grapple (remember the bigger the move, the brighter the color).  Trading is definitely happening on the few names with specific news (and there are some like PORTEL issuing a 6 year bond, or ALOFP – Alstom – whose merger with GE is coming under scrutiny by the EU), but most individual credits seem currently a bit left on the side lines.
"
"Who Wants To Catch A Falling Knife?. Earlier in the week MTNLN (Matalan) reported their FY15 results. They were in line with earlier guidance, but were however overshadowed by the announcement of the material impact from execution issues associated with the transition to their new distribution centre in Liverpool. That first sent MTNLN’s 5 year risk 50bps wider to 510bps. Since then, credit indices have been bouncing around with contradicting headlines regarding Greece and the market has been bracing itself for a return to a positive basis environment on iTraxx Crossover, after a few months of chronic negative basis (which probably had something to do with yield hungry investors in a zero interest rate world). That means that when arbitragers will show up, they are now more likely to ask for offers of protection on MTNLN, when they had consistantly been selling since last October. So dealers tried to figure out where the natural offer level is. At the close, they were still looking for it, despite a 56bps widening of MTNLN’s risk premium.
"
"Is Greece Really Going To Default?. The credit market is closing wider after a week-end which did not bring us any closer to a deal between Greece and Europe. Talks were cut short on Sunday, and the tone was defensive from the word “go”. iTraxx Main and iTraxx Crossover were quoted 3.5bps and 12bps wider at the open respectively, at 72bps and 320bps. And it got worse, as the market drifted to 74.5bps and 335bps, but it did not feel panicky and profit taking was quite obvious above 74bps and 330bps. These flows eventually brought the credit market back to its opening levels. It was the same story on options where flows were two-way and one could argue they were actually bullish as investors used the widest levels to buy receivers, ie options that will enable them to sell protection at a later date. Are we really a few weeks away from a Greek default? Credit investors do not appear to think so. 
"
"Contagion?. One can argue that volumes on the sovereign reference entities are not what they once were and it would be difficult to say otherwise. Nevertheless, they still rank among the most actively traded entities in the CDS market, and peripheral countries like Italy and Spain top the chart in terms of volumes together with Russia, Turkey, Brazil and Mexico. Despite the recent shockwaves sent by the standoff between Greece and its creditors, it is difficult to spot any sign of stress among investors regarding Italy, Portugal or Spain as you can see on the above grapple which graphs Spain’s 5 year risk premium. This CDS widened 15bps yesterday to 101bps, but there was no follow through today and it does not even stand at the widest level of the year. Like the rest of the market, the sovereign compartment seems fairly relaxed about any possible contagion.
"
"More Volatility Ahead?. Today was the third Wednesday of the month. Hence it was the expiry of credit index options maturing in June. It has been advertised as one of the busiest option maturity ever. Indeed, many investors had chosen to express views on the Greek conundrum using this maturity as the beginning of June was seen until recently as the most likely resolution date for the current crisis. That was eventually proven wrong, and the market will have to cope with many more contradicting headlines for a few more sessions or maybe weeks. In any case, a side effect of these earlier optimistic assumptions was the build-up of big positions on the 75bps strike on iTraxx Main and on the 325bps strike on iTraxx Crossover, making the market quite sticky around these levels. That was probably an explanation of the difficulty experienced by the market to widen meaning over the past few sessions. That safety net is now gone, and credit could be a bit more volatile into the second fortnight of June. 
"
"They Did It Again. If you just browse through the closing levels of credit indices, you will discount today's session as another day for (almost) nothing, bar a bit of compression. But that does not tell the whole story, as there was a fairly uncomfortable moment when index widening felt unstoppable. At the end of the European morning session, iTraxx Main went from 77bps to 80bps in flash, iTraxx Crossover from 335bps to 350bps and iTraxx Financial Senior, which felt the most vulnerable of all, from 92bps to 99bps. It took a rumour regarding some debt relief offered to Greece to stop the rot and credit is closing unchanged across the board, single names and indices alike. Some were hoping that the brief spike wider was the capitulation the market needed before it can take a leg tighter. It actually never quite felt like the end of the world, so we might go to new wides before the rally can begin in earnest.
"
"Grexit or  Grefix?. Uncertainty is at its highest level of the year in the European market. Today price action was hectic but it was more a reflection of actual risk premium.  Credit index were tighter with hedging reduction especially the iTraxx Crossover which is pricing 5% of default rate per year over the next 5 years. Investment Grade (IG) cash has under-performed: in case of a Grexit, IG spreads  will widen more  than any other credits due to the increasing systemtic risk, in case of a Grefix (let us try it) rates should be higher. Credit curves have stopped steepening. The risk aversion is moving front end in case of a Grexit and forward premium are too high in case on a Grefix.   Managing a European credit book was highly demanding and if you were just looking for a safe harbor, the attached grapple  shows how IG single CDS spreads in the US have  hardly moved  over the week.
"
"Bull… Bull… Bull…. Usually the business day following the 19th of June is all about roll. Indeed, this is the date when the maturity of “on the run” CDS is extended by a quarter. Today, when dealers started quoting 5y, they meant September 2020 maturity and no longer June 2020 as they did on Friday. Given that, one would expect the 5 year CDS, which is the risk premium you pay to protect yourself until the maturity of your contract against the default of the referenced entity, to go up. But on the back of new found optimism regarding Greece, which mainly hinged on the fact that they were not told to go its separate way during the day, it was as if the roll never took place. Not only on the run 5 year CDS were not wider, but they were effectively much tighter than last Friday. The bullishness of the market is also obvious when you look at the time series of any credit index. Today was the biggest one day move tighter in almost 3 years, actually since Mr Draghi delivered his “Whatever it takes” speech.
"
"Will Ladbrokes Bet Their Future On Gala?. Even though the credit market was a tad volatile, it was very much in consolidation mode after yesterday’s hectic rally. While they were taking their breath back, investors were also able to have a closer look at some special situations. And, if the general direction still pointed to tighter risk premia (the fair value of iTraxx Corssover was 6bps tighter at 292.5bps and the fair value of iTraxx Main was 1.5bps tighter at 63.25bps), a handful of names were indicated wider. LADLN (Ladbrokes Plc) for instance saw its 5 year risk premium increased by 14.5bps to 252bps. The company confirmed talks with Gala Coral regarding a possible merger are currently taking place. There are a number of possible scenarios depending on the price paid for Gala, the cash portion of the deal, and the entity that could issue debt going forward. Each of them can lead to very different outcomes regarding the risk premium of LADLN, ranging from virtually 0 to more than 500bps. Attention can still be paid to other pieces of news that the noise surrounding the Greek quagmire.
"
"Compression Driven By Positioning . DTCC released their weekly statistics this morning and, even though things have probably changed somehow since the beginning of the week given the magnitude of the moves the credit market has experienced, they back some of the trends that were at play recently. Among them was compression, and it is still clear for all to see on the above grapple. iTraxx Main (ITXEB) has tightened faster than iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) based on its historical beta. The fear that Grexit could become reality prompted buy side investors to cut their long risk positions on ITXEB series 23 by $6.3bln to $14.2bln, while they actually added risk on ITXEX series by $300m to $1.3bln. 
"
"Deal? Or No Deal?. Today was probably the most ridiculous we have experienced so far in terms of headlines regarding the Greek saga. As usual though, we eventually finish the day not much wiser concerning the outcome of the negotiations, which is reflected in the benign daily changes. The market appears fairly sanguine about the whole thing as it always manages to grind its way back tighter, but that masks brief spells during which the liquidity just evaporates and credit indices gap a few bps for iTraxx Main or 10bps or more for iTraxx Crossover. We had a few such instances during today’s session when we were told that “INSTITUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY AGREED ON GREECE PAPERS” or later that “GERMANY'S SCHAEUBLE SAYS GREEKS HAVE MOVED BACKWARDS”. Hopefully, that period of sterile volatility should soon be over as we have also been told that “SCHELLING SAYS SUNDAY IS DEADLINE FOR GREEK DEAL”. But we have all heard that before.
"
"Are Telcos For Sale? Their CDS Are Not!. Recent sessions have seen compression of all kinds. At a macro level iTraxx Crossover has outperformed iTraxx Main for instance. But that was also true at a micro level, and the tighter risk premia have moved slower than the wider ones during the tightening that took place over the last week. And among the names which have resisted the most to that move, telco companies were notable underperformers. It was quite tricky to get hold of good offers for protection across the sector and today only confirmed this. TMT has been a fertile ground for M&A; recently, but it has mainly affected the High Yield space. Investors seem to anticipate consolidation involving investment grade companies going forward. Their fears (maybe hopes?) were confirmed to a certain extent earlier in the session when the CEO of Altice told a newspaper that KPN (Ladbrokes Plc) could be on their menu. If the market keeps on rallying, TMT names might not play catch for a while.
"
"Not A Walk In The Park But.... When the news broke on Friday night that Greece will hold a referendum on Sunday 5th July to decide whether they want a chance to remain part of the Euro (even though the question is not spelt that way), and later during the week-end that bank holidays would be imposed in Greece until then (some banks might actually open next Thursday), market participants feared the worst and the opening levels of credit indices reflected a good deal of risk aversion. iTraxx Main (ITXEB) traded at 80bps and iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) at 350bps, up from 66.5bps and 290.75bps on Friday. These were actually the widest levels and from there some two way flows developed. The session felt orderly and protection sellers effectively dominated the debate during the best part of the day, taking ITXEX to 325bps and ITXEB to 74bps before a late protection buying spree almost took the market back to the opening levels on little volumes. So in credit, it would be tough to say it was a good session for risk (red largely dominates the above grapple), but it was nowhere near the panic some had predicted, even though we have certainly not seen the end of it.
"
"I Can Default Too. “We won’t let the heavy burden of inherited debt send us to our knees”. Does that sound familiar? Well, this is what Mr Alejandro Garcia Padilla, Governor of Puerto Rico said in a televised interview yesterday night. The island state will seek to delay the payments on its $72bln debt for “a number of years”, and a debt restructuring plan should be put together before the end of August. Fitch duly took note and lowered Porto Rico’s rating to CC, which means that “default of some kind appears probable”. A few US financial entities still have significant exposure to Puerto Rico. Unsurprisingly MBI (MBIA AA), AGO (Assured Guaranty Corp), FSA (Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp), which are the most exposed monolines, were the most affected. On top of the 100bps, 90bps and 70bps widening their respective risk premia suffered yesterday, they added another 70bps, 30bps and 30bps today.
"
"Back To Where They Belong. Over the past year, we have been given the opportunity to comment the fact that bases, and more specifically the iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) basis, had turned more negative since the launch of the series 22 in Europe. Most of the time, ITXEX has traded tighter than its theoretical value. But since April the dynamics seems to have changed. Bases have edged wider across the board, and this phenomenon gained speed recently. With the latest twists in the Greek saga and the announcement on Friday night of a referendum, the ITXEX basis has even reached level not seen since 2012 as investors rushed to buy protection on indices in Europe, leaving single names behind on Monday. Since then, indices came back from the wides and single names played catch up, bringing bases to more reasonable levels. Given the acrimonious tone between Mr Tsipras and Greece’s creditors since the beginning of the week, whatever the outcome of Sunday’s vote, the market will remain cautious for a while and there will be bumps along the road. That means that demand for macro hedges should be here to stay and together with it, positive bases.
"
"PSPP To The Rescue. This morning, the ECB expanded the list of agencies whose securities are eligible to be purchased under the Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP). The list created some buzz as it included three partially state-owned corporates, all of them Italian actually. In particular, the debt of ENEL ( Enel Spa ) will be included in the programme from now on. There is no definition of why they have chosen these specific bonds, but the bias for periphery names was obvious, and some saw this move as a policy signal from the ECB that it is prepared to take pre-emptive action to mitigate any negative effect from the events in Greece should the result of Sunday’s referendum be a resounding “NO”. That gave an early positive tone to the credit market which somewhat faded afterwards, but ENEL’s 5 year risk premium, which usually has an important beta to iTraxx Main which closed flat on the day, finished the session 16bps tighter at 82bps.
"
"All Bets Are Off. With the US closed, no one was expecting a frantic day of trading. It was all about position squaring ahead of the all-important referendum on Sunday. And with the result to close to call (the latest polls are showing “yes” and “no” neck to neck at 41 to 42% each), it seemed that investors felt slightly under hedged. That led to a weak session with all European credit indices closing wider, but that also led to an underperformance of what are traditionally used as Grexit proxies. iTraxx Main (+1.75bps at 75bps) decompressed substantially compared with iTraxx Crossover (+2.375bps at 325bps when its beta to Main is above 4). iTraxx Financials Sub finished 8.5bps wider at 180bps, which was the biggest move of all. People have taken chips off the table before bets were officially off, and they are now bracing themselves for a fierce move on Monday at the open. Indeed, everyone expects a 15% spread move one way or the other.
"
"Panic? ""Oxi"" Says The Market. Even though the outcome of the Greek referendum was said too close to call on Fraiday, most people were actually expecting the “yes” would prevail. And in any case, no one expected the “no” to win with such a comfortable margin. So barring the early wide prints on iTraxx Main (ITXEB at 81bps) and iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX at 350bps), the market was extremely well behaved. Given the magnitude of the news, the trading ranges were minimal (2bps on ITXEB and 10bps on ITXEX). The different indices also reacted according to their respective beta, which was certainly not what people expected. It is also worth noting that bases are closing at levels which are largely unchanged across the board. Market participants seemed happy enough with the news that Mr Varoufakis is no longer Greek finance minister, and decided not to focus on the longer term risk of political contagion to other countries. They will probably react should progress on a deal falter this week though.
"
"Time To Look Away From Greece. Much attention has been paid to Greece recently, and it has eclipsed pretty much everything else over the last week or so. It was front and centre today again, but some other themes are starting to emerge. The collapse of Chinese equities since mid-June, and the sell-off of the oil market (Brent and WTI which lost roughly 15% since the beginning of the month) are grabbing some attention. On the back on these negative headlines, the sectors of the commodities and energy were put under pressure. AALLN (Anglo American Plc), GLEINT (Glencore Plc) were the main casualties of the session, and they saw their 5 year risk premia raise 25.5bps to 217.5bps and 22bps to 204bps respectively. Also, tomorrow will mark the beginning of the reporting season. We shall see whether  this can get a bit of attention as well.
"
"Fraud Will Always Be The Issue. As long as fraud is a possibility, there will be some asymmetry when you get exposure to the credit of a company. If Parmalat is the poster child for such situation, we keep having examples of companies getting punished after revelations are made of suspicious behaviour. We have heard of a few accounting issues over the last year for instance, but the most recent example is ISOLUX. Its 5 year risk premium went a good deal wider yesterday when a Spanish judge rejected a request to stop investigating the company chairman as part of a corruption probe. The question has been lingering since last year and ISOLUX said “the company is not part of the investigation so we don’t really see this as an issue that could affect the business performance”, but the current atmosphere is not for leniency and investors do not give easily the benefit of the doubt at present.
"
"Ready… Steady…. Since Mr Tsipras surprised everybody with the announcement of a referendum a couple of weeks ago, the basis of all the indices in Europe (ie the difference between their quoted value and the theoretical value computed with the prices of their constituents) have been consistently positive. And these bases were actually at levels only seen in period of stress, as they reached more than 1% on iTraxx Crossover and 50cts on iTraxx Main. Since Monday, they have been converging towards 0 which is nicely setting  the scene for a potential big move once the final outcome of the negotiations (if one can call recent meetings negotiations given the 2 parties appear no closer than they were 4 months ago) is eventually known. Next Monday, the so-called deadline to find an agreement will have lapsed, and technicals should not prevent the market to gap one way or the other.
"
"Could It Be A “NAI”?. Greece tested the midnight deadline, but they eventually came with proposals late yesterday. It looks as if they show some meaningful concessions, and that was enough to restore optimism in the market. The gap is not closed yet, and there remains some hurdles to clear before Europe has a deal in earnest to keep Greece in the Euro. The Greek parliament has to validated the measures, and the Eurogroup has to accept them, which despite France best effort is not a given (some German lawmakers were quoted as saying that the “Greek reform proposals are no basis for further negotiations” and that “Greece needs a new start with its own currency” as Sunday’s referendum has not been forgotten by everybody). Nevertheless, risk premia ripped tighter across the board. Once credit indices got going, they never looked back and they are closing at the tightest levels of the day: iTraxx Main (ITXEB) 7.625bps tighter at 67.75bps and iTraxx Crossover 32.5bps tighter at 297bps.
"
"There Ought To Be One. As no one expected Greece to bow to all the demands of the Eurogroup, the market opened on a weak note. But just after the first trades took place, it was announced that a deal had been reached between Greece and its European creditors. Risk premia ripped tighter across the board. Not every single one of them though. While most iTraxx Crossover’s (ITXEX) constituents followed the index which went from 12bps wider to 12bps tighter in the blink of an eye, MTNLN’s (Matalan) 5 year CDS remained stubbornly wider. The company released their Q1 results for 2015/2016, and they confirmed the supply chain issues they have been facing with the transition to their new Northern warehouse. Guidance has been revised down accordingly, and even though arbitragers trying to take advantage of ITXEX trading expensive (ie tighter) compared with it sfair value were selling protection, MTLN’s 5 year risk premium ended 59bps wider at 867bps.
"
"Time Out Please!. Today was much quieter than the previous few sessions. It was quieter in terms of move’s amplitude and it was quieter in terms of volumes. I would love to say that it had to be expected given Paris was closed for Bastille Day, but the reality is that the market just needed to take a breather. During the last few weeks, Grexit was called and cancelled a couple of times leading to daily moves in excess of 10% of iTraxx Main’s (ITXEB) risk premium. This time, it looks as if the question has been answered for good, at least for a few months (indeed, the liquidity crisis has been eased for the time being, but none of the other issues have been solved) and iTraxx Main (ITXEB) has gone from 81bps last Tuesday to 65bps at the close, which certainly justifies a pause for thought. Markets could definitely use a few more quiet sessions to shake off the Greek fatigue which has set in.
"
"Time To Flatten?. The session was fairly quiet and option expiry made sure iTraxx Main was pinned at 65bps for most of the day, even though the open positions were not that big. The consolidation phase is still under way, and credit traded sideways for most names. We highlighted previously how brutal the move had been from the widest levels, and credit indices have now come full circle and stand where they were at the beginning of June. But if curves duly steepened during the widening - as one would expect during a move which does not imply the end of the world -, they fail to flatten when the market came all the way back. Longer dated risk premia are as wide compared with 5 year risk premia as they have ever been this year. That is consistent with ever growing uncertainties about what the future keeps in store and corporates taking advantage of the extra low yield environment to issue 8 to 10y bonds. Nevertheless, people are beginning to question the steepness of the CDS curves, and they could consolidate a bit – but my guess is not much – in the coming sessions.
"
"The Earning Circus Rolled Into Town. With all the noise made around Greece, one would be forgiven to have forgotten that the earning season has begun a week ago. If most of the results announced so far did not have a direct impact on risk premia, earnings release for the names with the most stretched credit metrics can have brutal consequences. Such was the case for NSINO ( Norske Skogindustrier ) today. They reported a poor quarter as cost reductions were not enough to offset lower volumes and capacity utilisation, as well as a weaker sales mix and some adverse FX impact, which eventually led to a quarterly EBITDA meaningfully lower than the market consensus. Even though the company kept buying some of their 2016 bonds in the market which could indicate their commitment to repaying these, big question marks exist regarding the capacity of NSINO to service their debt in the long run. In an otherwise bullish session, NSINO’s 5 year CDS was marked substantially wider at 56.5pts upfront. To protect $1 of NSINO's debt against a default of the company over the next 5 years, you need to pay 56.5cts right away and then 5cts per year.
"
"Here Is The Summer Lull. The market has been strong all week, and today was no exception. There was a bit of volatility during the session when some residual hedges were unwound and iTraxx Main touched 59bps while iTraxx Crossover touched 260bps. But these moves were made in fairly low volumes and the closing levels mainly show some decompression driven by the outperformance of the Financial subset. On their side, single name CDS were remarked tighter across the board, but that happened without hardly any trading activity. Dealers were extremely defensive when it came to buying protection, after a week of one way traffic regarding flows it has to be said as most clients were looking for bids in CDS. The appetite for risk (be it long risk or short risk) is fading fast and market makers expect more difficulties to recycle positions as we are entering the heat of the summer.
"
"Bye Bye Greece! Hello China!. It looks as if the focus eventually turned away from Greece. It would probably not take much for it to grab the market’s attention again, but today the focus was on what could be a much bigger problem if it unravels: the slowing of the Chinese economy. The first signs are to be found in the commodities area, which are trading near or at the lows of the year. Last week higher beta energy names underperformed particularly in the US, and this trend continued throughout the session. From the word “go”, protection was bid across the Energy and Basic Material sectors, and they provided the laggards in an otherwise fairly quiet session.
"
"Phew! It Is Only 152Bln!. A couple of months ago, TOSH’s ( Toshiba Corp ) accounting issues were made public. Since then, things have gone from bad to worse for bondholders and the risk premium has been on the rise. Fraud will always be the big danger for credit investors and represents a (hopefully remote in most cases) risk they are hardly compensated for. So when a company reveals its books have been doctored and profit artificially inflated, it should expect no mercy. That’s why TOSH’s 5 year CDS left the 40bps-50bps band where it looked to belong indefinitely and embarked on a roller coaster ride. An independent investigation of the company’s books was launched and the results were released at the very end of last week, which led TOSH to announce that earnings will be corrected by 152Bln yen. This was actually less than numbers which circulated for a while, and despite news that rating agencies put it under review for downgrade, investors’ relief translated into a 25bps rally of the 5 year risk premium, which closed at 105bps.
"
"BOMB Blowing Up. BOMB ( Bombardier, Inc. ) grabbed a fair share of attention today. It was not due to any results reported by the company, as they are yet to announce their earnings at the end of the month. There was no profit warning either, but one of their suppliers, B/E Aerospace Inc, told analysts on a conference call today that demand for large cabin jets “has come under pressure” in markets such as China, Russia and Latin America as governments and energy companies cut spendings. That was enough to send BOMB’s stock plummeting (it fell 18% at some stage before recovering somewhat to -8%) and to send its 5 year risk premium surging 120bps to 800bps.
"
"Love It One Day, Hate It The Next. Since early March until early July, the trend was obvious. Buying protection on iTraxx Main (ITXEB) and selling protection on CDXIG in the US was a winning trade day in day out. People were betting heavily against Greece using ITXEB and were looking to get some of their carry back selling CDXIG CDS. On the most recent series, the spread between ITXEB and CDXIG went from -6bps on March 23rd to +9bps on July 6th, the day after the Greek referendum. Since then, Mr Tsipras decided to bow to Greece’s creditors’ demands, pushing the day when the Greek debt pile problem will have to be addressed further down the line. At the same time, investors took note of the commodities’ tumble. So suddenly the energy heavy CDXIG did not look such a safe investment anymore, while Europe did not appear that risky under the close guard of the ECB. We have gone full circle in 4 months and the ITXEB/CDXIG spread is back to -7bps.
"
"Full Metal, not Stainless. AALLN  ( Anglo American Plc ) reported today its earnings for the first half of 2015.   With a reduction of the EBITDA by 36%, no dividend cut, very negative perspective on the iron ore prices, the credit investors had to comfort themselves with an assets’ sale program. The equity investors cheered first the earnings with the stock price up 4% but at the closing the stock was down 3.5%. The credit investor got it right. The CDS traded weaker all day long, closing 27bps wider at 265, the widest over the last three years as you can see on the attached grapple. This is just 20bps apart from the iTraxx Europe Crossover index. AALN is on the edge of losing its investment grade status and become a fallen angel with heavy metal wings.
"
"Ah Summer! Let's Decompress. During the most recent tightening phase that took iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) from 350bps early July to 260bps a week ago, the basis (i.e. the difference of ITXEX quoted prices and its theoretical value) reached extreme levels and was worth more than 80cts at times. When the commodities’ tumble started to get some air time and pushed the basic materials sector wider, the conditions were there for ITXEX to correct rapidly as it also includes the highest beta names. The 35 cent change in ITXEX’s basis explains more than half of ITXEX’s underperformance compared with iTraxx Main (ITXEB) from a beta adjusted basis. ITXEX widened 10bps more than its usual relationships to ITXEB would suggest, and it could be much more in the coming days if China does not stabilise.
"
"Caught Off Guard. What goes up has to eventually come down … in most cases anyway. That is definitely what happened to commodity related names today. Their credit risk premia, which have been put under severe pressure by the market over the last couple of weeks, consolidated and were marked tighter. It is only a one day move though, and no one is calling an end to their woes as their trajectory still points resolutely upwards. The same cannot be said for PORTEL (Portugal Telecom International Finance B.V.) and CWCLN (Cable & Wireless Limited) which saw their 5 year CDS keep moving wider by 30bps (to 606bps) and 36bps (to 207bps) respectively. There was no obvious explanation for the move, and people were blaming poor liquidity and bad dealers’ positioning in a seasonally thin market.
"
"All Over The Place. It could have been a quiet summer day, but the reporting session is in full swing in Europe. Combined with a flurry of headlines, they together triggered some volatility on a fairly large array of names. Some were wider like HEIGR ( HeidelbergCement AG ) after the company announced it intends to spend €3.7Bln to buy Italcementi (it signalled last month only that it was prepared to return money to shareholders!) or PORTEL (Portugal Telecom International Finance B.V.) which still suffers from its exposure to Brazil. Some were tighter like PEUGOT ( Peugeot SA ) whose results exceeded analysts’ prediction regarding their first half earnings as they pretty much achieved their targets, or WINDIM after it was rumoured that VimpelCom and Hucthison were close to merging their Italian assets. Unusually for a 29th July, the Grapple showing the daily variations of the European High Yield universe bears bright shades of both red and green.
"
"Greece Worries Us No More. Greece made its way back into the headlines. The IMF reiterated its unwillingness to provide more financing without debt relief by euro-member states and further reforms from the Greek government. The market (very) temporarily blipped wider but that was short lived as investors decided to fade the move and used it as an opportunity to peel hedges. This provided a fairly deep offer to indices and particularly iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) which compressed compared with iTraxx Main. At the same time, protection remained well bid in the European High Yield space, and quite aggressively so in some cases. Indeed the highest beta names continue to worry the market. ABGSM’s (Abengoa SA) 5-year-CDS was almost 6pts wider at 38.25pts upfront ahead of their results next week, ISOLUX’s was 2.5pts wider at 33.5pts and PORTEL (Portugal Telecom), which is fast closing on its widest levels in 3 years, still has not found any takers despite being 20bps wider at 645bps. ITXEX's negative basis could be here to stay a tad longer.
"
"A One-Day-Break To Finish The Month. The economic data released in the US generated some volatility on the equity markets. Stocks dipped after the US Employment Cost Index came out, but credit was largely unaffected. The trading range on all the credit indices was very narrow (1bp on iTraxx Main and 3bps in iTraxx Crossover) and they felt well offered throughout the session, even though volumes were on the low side. Continuing the trend of the week, protection is still better bid on single names but there was no major casualty to report, except CWCLN (Cable & Wireless Ltd) after they released the indicative terms of their new $750mln 7 year deal. The weakest names were given some respite to mark the end of the month, but many expect them to come under renewed pressure in the very near future.
"
"ABGSM Is Feeling The Heat. We have voiced a few times our frustration because of the lack of liquidity on the most recent inclusions in the iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) indices. So it is only fair to mention that ABGSM (Abengoa, SA) is one of the names which actually benefitted from being included in ITXEX since the series 21. It has seen volumes traded holding at respectable levels since the beginning of the year, and activity could remain high over the next few weeks/months for reasons the company’s debt holders will not appreciate though. The call between ABGSM’s management and analysts on Friday left the latter scratching their head as the company which previously appeared committed to de-levering announced out of the blue a capex increase and reduced FCF guidance. The communication around how the €500mln bonds due in 2016 will be managed was not very convincing either. Investors pushed the 5 year risk premium 12pts higher to 48.25pts (insuring $1 of ABGSM’s bond against a default costs 48.5cts spot and 5cts per year afterwards) and the 1 year risk premium to 30pts upfront. 
"
"I Decompress, You Decompress, They Decompress. Decompression was one of the themes often mentioned today at the close. With the continued pressure applied on ABGSM (Abengoa SA), iTraxx Crossover underperformed slightly iTraxx Main. iTraxx Financials Sub (+6bps on the day @ 155bps) underperformed iTraxx Financials Senior (flat on the day), and within the financial sector, high beta names underperformed low beta ones. Core bank names closed 1 to 2bps wider, while peripheral names closed 5 to 7bps wider. And among the peripherals, Spanish banks were the most active and continued to underperform, probably on the back of the ongoing weakness in Latin America. 
"
"Positioning Matters. The increase in dispersion among credits goes some way in explaining the current environment of negative index bases (i.e. the traded risk premia of indices is tighter than the theoretical values one gets using the risk premia of their constituents). There were some names which blew out (like ABGSM - Abengoa -, ISOLUX or NSINO - Norske Skogindustrier -), there were some names affected by the commodity’s fall which led investors to bid up protections on these. But that is only one side of the equation. The other of course is what happened on indices themselves. To that extend, the DTCC statistics released this morning regarding clients’ positioning as of the end of last week is quite telling. Compared with the week before, they added risk across the board and sold protection on CDXIG ($3.7bln more), HY ($700mln more), iTraxx Main S23 ($1.3bln more) and iTraxx Crossover S23 ($600mln more). On both side of the Atlantic, whatever is said about commodities, China or Latin America, clients have hardly ever been that long risk on indices.
"
"Brazil!. Yesterday, TITIM’s ( Telecom Italia Spa ) Brazilian subsidiary reported weak results, mainly due to a tough macroeconomic environment. And with mobile penetration rates now over 138% in the country, competition for subscribers will only get tougher. That put TITIM’s 5 year risk premium under a bit of pressure, and it widened by 3bps to 145.5bps. But the real casualty was PORTEL (Portugal Telecom), as retail investors, who had arguably little understanding of the structure under which PORTEL bonds trade since Oi bought the company, are finally realising that they are not Portuguese risk but in fact Brazilian risk, and have been selling them over the last few sessions. TITIM’s results appear to have been the catalyst for more aggressive selling because of the poor outlook for Brazil in general and this drove the bonds 5 to 8pts lower and the 5 risk premium CDS 3.875pts higher to 11.13%.
"
"Have tables Started To Turn?. Since the beginning of the summer we have been used to seeing the commodity related sectors underperform consistently the rest of the market. The fall of the commodity prices severely impacted the likes of RIG ( Transocean LTD ), ABX ( Barrick Gold Corp ), or FCX ( Freeport-McMoRan Inc ) and the risk premia of these high beta names were under severe pressure. Since the beginning of the week, there is a new cohort of names which joined the ranks of battered credits: media companies. It started with DIS ( Walt Disney Co ) which reported disappointing earnings raising concerns about subscriber erosion and the long term viability of the cable model, and rapidly spread to CBS ( CBS Corporation ), TWX ( Time Warner Inc ) and today BSY ( SKY pLc ). All of a sudden, it is no longer all about the widest credits, and low beta names appear vulnerable as well.
"
"Weekend du 15 août. With the Assumption, the next weekend is the peak of the holiday season in France.  The credit market has started the week as if it were already a Friday ahead of a long french weekend. The credit indices have been strong all day long with sellers of credit index protection and sellers of credit index options. The investors do not want to pay any premium. They are expecting a grind tighter in a low volatility environment over the next sessions.  The single CDS did not shared the positive tone looking at the daily variation of the single CDS (see attached Grapple). ABGSM ( Abengoa SA) spread is unchanged while the stock price is up 20%.  ABGSM won a 600M€ contract for a biomass power station in the UK. The CDS is unmoved and the price is closing 60% upfront + 5% running on the five years.   
"
"Far East Rising Risks. The iTraxx Asia Ex Japan Series 23 credit index is the benchmark that investors should monitor over the next sessions. It includes 40 credits, including most Asian sovereign credits. The index is closing 5 bps wider at 118, with little protection on the index offered in the market. Over the last 2 weeks, Asian sovereign credits have initiated a trend weaker as you can observe on the Grapple. Today, China CDS is closing 4 bps wider at 107bps but Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia are much weaker, closing around 8bps wider. For most of the Asian sovereign CDS, we are trading at the widest levels since last summer. The increase of the credit premiums for these economies has to be monitored as it could trigger a more pronounced selloff.
"
"Rock Solid like a European iTraxx. The credit market was a safe harbor today. The European iTraxx credit index complex hardly moved wider during the day while the equity market was turning sour. The iTraxx Europe Crossover Series 23 is closing only 8bps wider at 317bps and squeezing tighter after the London close. The credit indices are rock solid. The weakest name like Abengoa or Norske Skogindustrier are trading at 70% plus 5% running.  The premiums have little room to trade higher. For a further widening, the weak B are at risk but we need a real indiscriminate sell off to see the index back to a 400 handle.  Investors are sensitive to the credit quality and there is no indiscriminate selling pressure in the market. Only large redemption or unabated new issues could affect the global strength of the asset class.  
"
"No Indulgence for ONEOK. 
We should consider what happened today to OKE as being symptomatic of the current market environment. OKE  ( ONEOK , Inc ) 
is a Tulsa based diversified energy company owning  more that 40% of OKS  ( Oneok Partners LP ), the largest US NGL pipeline system owner. OKE increased its holding in OKS today. The acquisition is funded by a 500MUSD bond issuance. Adding 50% to their current outstanding debt, being an illiquid credit, losing their last investment grade rating today, they have to concede a large discount to the market to raise more debt, at a cost for current investors. Differentiation is growing from one issuer to another. The capital market is any more chasing the yield buy investors are looking at risks.
"
"Abengoa SA turns ""green"". ABGSM ( Abengoa SA) is one of the top European credit story of the summer. This company is specialized in green energies but has a complex, we could say abstruse, leveraged corporate structure coupled with weak earnings.  To survive, they have no choice than raising equity and selling assets. Today they announced that they intend to do both. The share price is closing 10% down.  The move is credit friendly. In the last two sessions, the cost to insure ABGSM debt decreased from 70% upfront + 5% per year to 60% upfront + 5% per year (the Grapple displays the equivalent running cost, currently around 45% per year) . 

The CDS is very active. The market has traded 100MUSD per day in average  the first week of august. DTCC will publish  next Wednesday the volumes for the current week. Some hedge fund initiated short positions on the equity but the CDS market is offering tenfold much more liquidity than the equity market.

"
"From bad to worse. We pointed out in our blog  the 22nd of July a brutal widening of BOMB ( Bombardier, Inc. ) credit default swap price. Since then, the CDS kept widening from 8% to 12% in a parabolic acceleration as you can observe on the grapple.  When the doubt comes, a spiraling selling pressure pushes debt prices down. The movement stops when the credit trades as distressed, the residual asset value post a credit event . The company is asking for time to deliver its reorganization. We do love their Canadair and their nice trains. This is not sufficient for investors looking at an impressive cash flow burn rate. Rumors surfaced in the market that the liquidity is too short for turning around the company. The management should look for a B plan.
"
"Noble, you  still haven't convinced me. NOBLSP (Noble Group Limited), the commodity trader based in HK, failed to convince  despite a long presentation to investors. The stock is down 8% today and the CDS price is 100bps wider, close to 10% per annum. The company has 2BUSD market capitalization for  6BUSD of debt. All is about the fair value gains on long dated contracts in their accounts. The fair valuation method is questionable. Spending hours to explain how it works causes more harm than good.
 
 The CDS price is not fair, it is real. They are interested buyers of credit protection.
"
"Bottom fishing, not yet. Having being hammered this year, investors are trying to find the turning point for European commodity companies. It is too early. GLEINT ( Glencore PLC) is the casualty of the day. Glencore managed quite well the decline in commodity prices. They are limiting the damages. The market applauded first. The stock opened up 4% in London. But the global sell-off in commodity markets today has just cancelled any positive sentiment.  The stock is closing down 10% and the CDS 27bps wider. Glencore.is eventually under-performing its peers due to speculative positive expectations.  Timing any pick up in commodity prices will be key for investors but we should remind ourselves on the fate of Drogo, the main character of The Tartar Steppe. 
"
"Selecta, you daily companion. SELNSW (Selecta Group BV) is the European leader in public vending machines.  Waiting for a train or at your office, you have likely used one of its 145,600 machines in Europe. The company was created in Switzerland in the late 1950s and was taken private by Allianz Capital Partners in a LBO in 2007, one of the last LBO before the GFC. The company reported its earning today and on the attached Grapple you can see how the credit market is actually trading on the fear. Ahead of the quarterly results, the 5Y CDS widened by 100bps to trade 11% upfront plus 5% running (850bps running). With revenues better that expected, the CDS came back  by 100bps today. The company is still facing large challenges with a net debt of 866MEuros for 122MEuros of EBIDTA. The business is a low margin business using a lot of CAPEX to invest in new machines. The company has little financial flexibility and Selecta can not yet refinance its debt on viable terms.
"
"Weekly rear view with the machine clusters. 
DataGrapple clusters CDS having the highest correlation one to another. The DataGrapple machine tree explores the CDS universe in clusters of similar behavior. There are two specific clusters. Both are including only the “new” CDS, the CDS which have started to trade only over the last year, like Selecta (see yesterday Blog) quoted since October 2014. These names are late LBO names. The distressed ""LBO"" cluster is 45bps wider (8%), the high yield ""LBO"" cluster is 20bps wider (6%). These names are currently the weakest part of the liquid credit market and they have room to trade weaker. As expected, the fourth worst performer is the emerging market cluster which is 11bps wider (+4%). Russia +40bps, Indonesia (+38bps) are leading this cluster. I recommend to the user opening the Grapple of the day via the Grapple Store, select 1W variation and click on the bars to go through the various clusters and see what happened during this peculiar week.

"No chaos in credit. The credit market was not the leader in the market sell-off today.  While the STOXX Europe 600 is 10% lower from its end of June closing (before the Greece referendum), the Crossover index is just 35bps wider at 364bps.  The realized volatility on credit indices is flat while the equity realized volatility has just doubled over the last 2 sessions. The commodity complex was the most active sector on the single names. But, the credit market was essentially active on the credit indices.   The indices behavior remained ""rational"" all day long. Looking at the Grapple and the variation of the various Europe on-the-run indices, all bubbles are aligned, the widening is proportional to the spread. The collective behavior of the credit premiums is dominant over any specific risk.  Such a behavior is a change over our last blogs, systematic risk is  back in the credit market. 
"
"Oil Turn?. All risky assets classes from commodity to credit or equity have rebounded today. The oil is back up but the turmoil in commodities is far from being over. In the credit space, the European  basic materials CDS market is very active, trading more than 300MUSD per day according to DTCC. The widening has been close to a straight line since the beginning of July for GLEINT (Glencore International AG), AALLN (Anglo American Plc) and XTALN (XSTRATA Limited) while the chemicals have been more stable with raw materials much cheaper. Today, the market U turn was uneven. Glencore is under performing Anglo American by 30bps.  If you change on the Grapple the window from a year to the whole sample, you can observe that Glencore has always been a high beta risk to Anglo American. There are a lot of hedging activities on Glencore due to its commodity trading operations.  Having Glencore CDS trading closer to Anglo American's one will be a strong signal of a real market turning point.

"Energy companies coming to their senses. 
If the trust is broken, if you have too much debt and if you are not a central banker, you just have one solution: raise new equity or at least stop paying your shareholders. When your financial situation deteriorates, you have to protect your creditors first and foremost. ABGSM (Abengoa SA)  has successfully mandated 3 banks for its 650MEuros capital increase. They are scoring one point and gaining some confidence back from their investors. The CDS is down 8% to 54% upfront plus 5% running from yesterday close.  ISOLUX the companion of misfortune is also tighter by 4.5% to 45.5%  + 5% running.  The remaining question is the size of the issuance.  If we remember what happened to banks during the GFC, the size of any capital increase was always too short. 

In the US, we had also a similar news, RIG  (Transocean LTD) has suspended its next 2 dividends. The CDS was tighter at the open but widen back during the session. RIG shall likely request more shareholders’ help.

"For ""les aoûtiens"". 
There is a word for August holiday makers in France, the “aoûtiens”. In August, most small businesses are closed in France. The  “aoûtiens” are outpacing the ""juilletistes”. So, for the  “aoûtiens” coming back to the office next Tuesday (London markets are closed next Monday), the Grapple of the day provides a summary of what happened in August in the CDS market. We are using the Machine classification. The worst performers are the LBO names in Europe as they have the highest negative convexity on refinancing. The next following under-performers are emerging sovereigns and continental Asia without a surprise. Surprisingly, US IG is under-performing US HY in this classification due to the energy complex. US HY appears to have reach a saturation level while Japan is the safe heaven. Also, looking at the stick providing the high/low during this month, we can see that we are closing wider but the markets came back half of the worst widening. With no surprise Asia Ex-Japan is lagging the recent market relief.
 
All market participants will be back next week. The CDS market will be very interesting next month. New index series will be issued at the end of the month.

"Rallye (RALFP): Time To Go Upfront?. The month of September begun with some familiar themes: Asia sent some very negative vibes overnight and commodities resumed their chaotic run. Emerging markets and more specifically Brazil are also weighing on investors’ sentiment. That was obvious from RALFP’s ( Rallye SA ) and COFP’s ( Casino Guichard Perrachon SA ) 5 year CDS price action which closed 85bps wider at 556bps and 13bps wider at 167bps respectively. RALFP definitely suffers from the continued weakness in Casino’s operations which are exposed to Brazil headwind. But the limited portfolio of assets that the company can sell in order to delever is also a concern and people begin to argue that RALFP’s risk premium is now looking tight when compared with names like Iceland or Boparan. It is now trading through the 500 level, and if the trajectory remains the same we will see upfront quotes very soon. 
"
"TSCO: $6Bln Definitely Helps. Since last fall, investors who are long TSCO ( Tesco Plc ) risk had a bumpy ride and the company’s risk premium has been rising consistently. So when it surfaced that TSCO could be near selling its South Korean business to MBK Partners for $6Bln, people greeted the news with a rare CDS tightening (-7.5bps at 212bps)! Indeed, the price tag is 10% above the most common expectations. It will enable TSCO to delever and put it back within its respective rating agencies threshold, even though a return to investment grade status is still not in the cards. One could argue that the reaction was fairly muted, but TSCO will need to reinvest into its UK proposition and an intensification of the price war in the UK cannot be ruled out.
"
"Another ECB Conference, Another Bull Day. Before the NFP release tomorrow, which people consider the most important economic print before the next and much anticipated FOMC on the 17th September, today was all about Central Bank as well. As was the case during most of his previous press conference, Mr Draghi did not disappoint the market and announced the ECB is getting ready to extend QE if needed. The credit index market anticipated that and all credit indices were firm from the word “go”. There was no panic selling of protection, but rather a steady grind. That was enough to leave the single name CDS market behind, particularly the Crossover universe in Europe, where some names are under severe pressure and are not over their summer woes (among them ABGSM – Abengoa- and ISOLUX were the most affected and both saw their risk premium go through the roof). The credit index bases (the difference between the traded levels of the credit indices and the theoretical values derived from their constituents) are back to the most negative levels of the year across the board. 
"
"Dispersion Still On The Rise. Despite the publication of the much talked about NFP in the US (which people struggled to interpret because of revisions contradicting the headline numbers) and of a jobless rate which now stands at a 7-year-low (which eventually led people to think that FED is closer to lift and triggered a broad based equity sell off), the price action on credit was fairly muted. The bulk of the names in the investment grade space did not see their 5 year risk premium move by more than a couple of bps, but there were a few outsized moves, especially in the commodity related area. Risk in that space has still not find a clearing level, and the CDS of AALLN ( Anglo American Plc ), GLEINT ( Glencore Plc ) and XTALN (Xstrata Ltd) have been on an uninterrupted upward trajectory since the beginning of June, bringing them respectively to 367.5bps, 447.5bps and 250bps from roughly 170bps a quarter ago.
"
"No One Touches My Rating!. GLEINT’s ( Glencore Plc ) 5 year risk premium is widening… no more. While no one can say if the tumble of commodities, which was behind the threefold increase of GLEINT’s CDS since June, is over, the company announced some bold measures to strengthen its balance sheet and protect the IG rating which matters so much to its business model. They will proceed with a fully underwritten $2.5bln right issue, save $2.4bln from the suspension of their dividend, go ahead with $2bln worth of asset sales, and suspend copper production at the loss making Katanga and Mopani operations. This is not necessarily good news for Zambia and Congo, but investors who are long risk GLEINT definitely breathed a sigh a relief. The stock closed the day up 7% and the 5 year CDS closed 121.5bps tighter at 326bps. The latter is not back to the tightest level of the year (by a fair margin and rightly so as commodity prices warrant more caution), but it explains 2/3 of the daily 1.5bps tightening of iTraxx Main fair value today.
"
"Novo Banco: One More Twist In The Saga. The auction of BESPL (Novo Banco, SA) is meant to be the final chapter of the restructuring of Banco Espirito Santo, in the wake of the unsustainable losses the bank incurred on loans made to other companies of the Espirito Santo family business empire which required a €5bln bailout from Portugal a year ago. The Portuguese authorities broke up the bank and transferred the healthy assets to BESPL, with a view to sell it and recover as much of the bailout cost as possible by the end of August. But on September 1st talks with the highest bidder (rumoured to be the Anbang Insurance Group, a Chinese company) faltered and the Bank of Portugal had to invite second-ranked bidder Fosun, another Chinese insurance and asset management company, at the negotiation table. It was recently announced that the outcome of this second attempt at selling BESPL should be known by September 14th, and in any case the Portuguese government would like the sale to be closed before the country’s parliamentary elections on Oct 4th. The uncertainty created by the whole process did not go down well with investors who had made BESPL one of their favourite financial long risk positions. The 5 year risk premium stabilised today, but it is back to the widest level of the last 3 years, more than double what it was a week ago.
"
"It Was Doomsday A Fortnight Ago. Between the 20th and the 24th August, it was literally impossible to sell risk and all asset classes experienced some tough times. Intraday, iTraxx Main (ITXEB) touched 80bps and iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) 380bps when the angst was at its worst… But these days are long gone now. More state intervention in China and a potentially still accommodative FED for a bit longer (a September rate hike is no longer investors’ base case scenario) were enough to completely turn the table. Equities rebounded vigorously from the recent lows and risk premia came back down in creditland. The magnitude of the moves in credit were less impressive than on equities on the way out and on the way in, but the grind tighter has been steady since the beginning of the week. A number of shorts cut their index positions as they see the September roll fast approaching. They provided a deep offer to both ITXEX and ITXEB and sent the bases to deeply negative levels.
"
"LatAm Fever. Markets were in consolidation mode today after their recent positive run. The defensive tone was set during the second part of the US session yesterday and overnight in Asia. It was compounded by the downgrade of Brazil to junk status (BB+ with a negative outlook still) by S&P;, not only for all the names with sizeable exposure to this country but also for companies which do business in Latin American. The effect was broad-based. Brazil’s 5 year risk premium was first in line (19.5bps wider at 387.5bps), and both financials and non-financials corporates suffered equally. The most impacted were SANTAN ( Banco Santander SA ) 7.5bps wider at 119.5bps, PORTEL (Portugal Telecom) 2pts upfront wider at 19.75pts + 500bps running, and RALFP ( Rallye SA ) 60bps wider at 545bps. That Latam related cohort represents a good portion of the red boxes (ie today’s laggards) in the above grapple.
"
"Is Italy Different From Denmark?. This morning, TELNOR ( Telenor ) and TLIASS ( TeliaSnoera AB ) announced the withdrawal of the merger in Denmark of their mobile operations. The companies were not able to agree with the European Commission on acceptable conditions to go ahead with their plan to create a player with a 45% market share, in effect creating a 2 player market (TDC would have had a similar 45% market share and Hutchison the remaining 10%). This was taken as a sign of a tougher stance towards mobile consolidation from new commissioner Vestager going forward. Even though the latter said one “cannot draw conclusion from failed Denmark merger for Hutchison merger bid in UK and Italy” and despite Italy’s more competitive landscape, investors’ started to ask questions regarding the proposed association of Vimpelcom and Hutchison’s mobile assets in Italy. That was enough to send the 5 year risk premium of WIND 40bps wider at 290bps.
"
"Kudos To Arbitragers!. In the past, credit indices have seen many technical situations arise. The most (in)famous was the London Whale episode during which protection on the series 9 of indices was sold aggressively and pushed the basis (difference between the quoted value of an index and the theoretical value derived from its constituents) to extremely negative levels on both CDXIG in the US and iTraxx Main (ITXEB) in Europe. Regularly, flow on “off the run” series create some dispersion in basis between index families, but also within index families. At the moment, the above grapple shows that currently on iTraxx Crossover (but you would have the same picture if you choose ITXEB) the basis is roughly a linear function of the maturity (i.e. it is the same expressed in bps irrespective of the maturity). It also shows that the ranges exhibit the same property over the last year. Bases seem unable to go out of the -20bps/+20bps cone. During that period, arbitragers had the resources to keep them in check.
"
"Atomic Provisions. For most of the credit market it was a day of 2 halves. Risk premia were wider in the morning and came back to almost unchanged once the US came in. One sector widened and never looked back though: utilities. The move happened on the back of an article in a German magazine highlighting concerns regarding the provisions made by the biggest German utilities towards the decommissioning of nuclear plants. The shortfall could be as high as 30Bln euros to pay for the disposal of nuclear waste. EOANGR  ( E.ON SE ), RWE ( RWE AG ) and ENBW ( Enbw Energie Baden Wuerttemberg AG ) bore the brunt of the risk selling. But while their stocks recovered in the afternoon once the German Economy Minister branded the report “irresponsible speculation”, their 5 year CDS kept trading wider- they all closed at the widest levels of the day, RWE at 143bps (+19bps), EOANGR at 95.5bps (+11.5bps) and ENBW at 77.5bps (+11bps) -, as a vast portion of investors own bonds of these usually uneventful names. 
"
"They Were Not Just Out For A Drink. According to various press reports, Altria, which controls 27% of SABLN ( SAB Miller Plc ), recently pulled out of a conference appearance to follow up on a similar action by ABIBB ( Anheuser Busch Inbev SA ). People were quick to think something was brewing and today ABIBB confirmed it had made an approach to SABLN’s board. This acquisition would be the biggest in the industry history and would cap more than a decade of consolidation across brewing companies, as consolidation has been used as a way to stave off a slowdown in established markets such as Europe and the US. Even though a deal is currently much more affordable because the price action of SABLN’s has been weak over the last 6 months, the deal would likely cost ABIBB more than $100bln. If both the stocks of both company reacted positively, that is a big number and investors pushed ABIBB’s 5 year risk premium 11bps wider to 79bps, the most in almost 3 years.
"
" Will They Survive The Winter?. NSINO (Norske Skogindustrier ASA) is in a tricky situation. Well, their bondholders are anyway. The company has NOK896mln cash on hands, it is burning NOK100mln every quarter, and they have to deal with NOK295mln bonds maturing October 15th, 2015 and NOK983mln bonds maturing June 15th, 2016. It also has bonds due in 2017 and 2019. Unless something is done very soon, it is obvious that it will face some problems. To complicate matters further the 2019 bonds are secured, while the 2015, 2016 & 2017 are not. The owners of the 2019 bonds will probably claim that the value breaks in 19s, and that redeeming at par the 15s, let alone the 16s or the 17s, is not an option. They should come (sooner rather than later) with a proposal that will aim at fixing the business and putting the company on a viable financial trajectory. Their proposal would most likely wipe the unsecured bonds out. The holders of the unsecured bonds will try and keep some optionality and probably suggest an exchange on their bonds into cash plus longer dated securities. It seems that the 2019 holders are about to fire first as we heard today that a number of them have had financial advisory pitches presented to them, and that NSINO had appointed Houlihan Lokey to help them examine options. Unsurprisingly, investors reacted by bidding up short dated protection, sending 1 year CDS at 39pts upfront plus 500bps running.
"
"Technicals Or Fundamentals?. If you ask any participant in the credit market, they will unanimously say that today was a very robust session compared with other asset classes. While the EuroStoxx closed 2.5% lower on the day, iTraxx Main was only 2bps wider at 71.1bps, and iTraxx Crossover was 8bps wider at 324.25bps. Some will argue that credit is to a large extent immune to the currency moves that affected equities. With people now pricing a long delay in any potential FED hike, the euro was up more than 1% overnight which probably contributed to European equity weakness. But another reason is the coming roll into the next series of indices which will take place on Monday. Series 24 will be issued in Europe and Asia (except Japan which is closed and will roll on the 24th) and series 25 will be issued in the US. Barring any sensational news, people are always reluctant to buy protection ahead of the roll and liquidity was relatively thin. Hedgers were not particularly keen to lift the current series and seemed happy to wait for the new ones on Monday. On the back of these technical, people are bracing themselves for a choppy open on Monday.
"
"VW : Choking On Emissions. After admitting they cheated on U.S. air pollution for years, VW ( Volkswagen AG ) risk as much as $18bln in fines. The company equipped some diesel cars with “defeat devices” software which turn on pollution controls only when cars are undergoing emissions testing. However, during normal operations, some emissions (particularly nitrogen oxide emisssions – Nox) are way above the standard allowed under US regulations (40 times in the case of NOx). The issue affects 482k cars sold since 2009, but also unsold 2015 models and the Environmental Protection Agency has refused to certify some 2016 models. The depth and breadth of the situation is currently unclear as one cannot rule out that VW has undertaken similar practises in other geographies with other environmental regulations. So no one was stepping in to buy risk in VW today and the mood was very cautious towards automakers as a whole. VW’s chief executive Martin Winterkorn said he was “deeply sorry” to have broken customers’ trust. Investors were sorry too! While the company’s stock lost 17% today, VW’s 5 year risk premium jumped 60bps at 135.5bps.
"
"The Weaker Were The Weakest. Not many saw that straight line sell off coming. There was a tame attempt intraday around noon to turn the tide, but once the US came in, it was “run for hills time” as a market participant put it, and the widening carried on into the close. Given the velocity of the move, there won’t be too many people taking the other side of the trade yet and no one will rush into a long risk position. Credit was weak across the board, but the names that were the most affected are the names that were already under pressure. For instance, it is likely that a few investors who tried a “long risk autos” yesterday got spooked by the resumption of the widening trend today and threw the towel. VW closed another 85bps (!!) wider at 221bps, and dragged all the auto sector in its wake. Commodity related names and utilities, which already had a tough summer, also had a torrid session. 
"
"Index Bases: More Of The Same. The roll and the launch of the new series of indices have not brought a sea of change to the credit market. On the one hand, credit indices remain an investment vehicle of choice and most index rolls between new series and the previous ones trade below their fair value (with the exception of iTraxx Financials in Europe where clients are still short risk). This means that new series are more expensive (i.e. they trade tighter relative to their values) than the previous ones. On the other hand, there are numerous stories affecting single names. The commodities’ saga is still unfolding, Emerging Markets are a concern to investors, and the automotive sector is having a brutal time (particularly in Europe) to name a few. So one should not be surprised to see the negative index credit bases environment persist for some time.
"
"Persistent weakness in European Credit. This Friday, the credit market underperformed significantly the equity market. The credit indices are closing nearly unchanged while the equity indices are closing up 3% in Europe.  Investors are reviewing the risk reward of their investment grade portfolios, especially in Europe post VW outrageous conduct and a lack of support on mining companies.  The European investment grade credit index which was the safest credit instrument has broken its positive perception. In September, among the 125 iTraxx Europe members, the 10th decile of the largest premiums has reached five times the level of the 90th decile of the lowest premiums.  The ratio was between 3 and 4 post the European crisis, and it was just below 4 at the end of August.  The credit risk is coming back quickly in European. More problematic, the iTraxx Europe Series 24, one of the strongest credit instrument, has traded really poorly in the afternoon before cooling into the close. Next week, we could have volatile sessions with monthly and quarterly rebalancing.  If investors are looking to hedge their credit exposures with a cheap iTraxx Europe index, not everyone will be filled.
"
"Liquidity Or Solvency?. Even though investors who took part in GLEINT’s ( Glencore Plc ) IPO have not been in the money for long, the company was worth well in excess of GBP50bln not long ago. After today’s slump, GLEINT is valued at less than GBP10bln. Despite all the management’s efforts to protect their investment grade rating (the company sold new stock, scrapped its dividend and is said to have hired a couple of investment banks to sell a stake in their agricultural business), their debt pile, which roughly amounts to USD35bln, makes some analysts think that they have become more vulnerable to falling prices of copper, coal, zinc and nickel. A report published today speculated that depressed commodity prices could wipe out completely GLEINT’s equity value. Up to now, people have focused on the liquidity position of the company, but they are now questioning its solvency. So not only did the 5 year risk premium of GLEINT widen aggressively today (+362bps at 917bps), but traders also begun to invert the risk premium curve. The 1 year risk premium was marked 800bps wider at 1170bps.
"
"Weak But Constructive?. Credit indices are stuck at their widest levels of year, and in fact at their widest levels of the last couple of years. Following a very heavy session in Asia, where indices, which include a fair number of commodity related companies, had a poor session and saw their risk premia closed 10 to 15% wider (iTraxx Asia Ex Japan +15bps at 167bps; iTraxx Japan +8.5bps at 83bps; iTraxx Australia +8.5bps at 140bps), iTraxx Main (ITXEB) and iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) headed towards 95bps and 395bps in a few prints. But they rapidly got back to unchanged with early profit takers from the real money space. Despite the equity volatility, ITXEB could not reach its initial wides again, and only managed to trade back up to 94 later in the morning, and then 93 in the afternoon with US accounts apparently better sellers of protection. Credit indices eventually closed unchanged across the board in Europe and in the US, which is somewhat in line with equities. At the close, the mood certainly appeared more upbeat, and some could call it cautiously constructive. The next few days will tell us whether GLEINT, VW and the likes have finally find a floor, or if we are merely witnessing some end of quarter damage limitation exercise.
"
"Everybody To The Right… Everybody To The Left. Like every other quarter, AA ( Alcoa Inc ) will be among the first to report at the very beginning of the second week of October. But while the results might get any scrutiny and generate some volatility as commodity related names have been under the spotlight recently, AA already proved over the last few days that it is not a credit for the faint hearted. On Monday, the company announced its plan to break itself in two by separating its manufacturing operations (the “Value-Add” business still to be named) from the legacy smelting and refining business (which will retain the Alcoa name) that is struggling to overcome booming production from China. Investors were unsure where the debt might end up, and they feared that the bonds might go to the less attractive part of the business, i.e. Alcoa. Accordingly, they sent AA’s 5 year risk premium 140bps wider at 457bps, meaning that a 5 year bond lost roughly 7cts on the dollar on that day. The company management issued a statement late yesterday saying that “Alcoa’s current intent is that the debt of Alcoa would be retained by the Value-Add company for which Alcoa is targeting an investment grade rating”. Guess what? AA’s 5 year risk premium closed at 335bps tonight.
"
"It Does Happen In Japan Too. Japan has a reputation of low yields and low credit risk premia. But recently that market has known a few shocks, and even some defaults. One of them impacted a member of iTraxx Japan Series 24, MITSOL ( Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd ). The company did not default, but it saw its 5 year risk premium marked meaningfully wider from 120bps to 150bps after  Daiichi Chuo KK  filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo with 120bln yen ($1bln) in liabilities. MITSOL owns 16.5% of the Japanese shipping line and could be in line to lose 30bln yen according to some analysts. That event alone should not threaten the viability of MITSOL, but it shows that idiosyncratic risk is rising everywhere and that the dispersion that has increased dramatically in Europe and in the US over the last year or so is going up globally. More than ever, investors have to make sure they choose wisely.
"
"The Return Of Credit Derivatives. Central bankers can do a lot to prop up asset prices and they have been quite successful at it over the last five years. But they are powerless to tackle the sharp rise in idiosyncratic risks such as the higher burden on German utilities to clean their nuclear power plants, the engines’ performances’ falsification by automakers, the excess leverage taken by commodity companies, or EM specific risk such as Brazil which affected European companies which were heavily invested in the country. The renewed alpha in European investment grade credit was a wakeup call for investors. Single name traded volume surged in September. Everyone was expecting an increase with the roll that took place the week beginning the September 21st, but even the week before volumes had ballooned to 20Bln USD per day, twice the average since early 2015. In September, cash bonds were harder to trade and investors used single name CDS to manage their exposure. Could credit derivatives be flavour of the day once again?
"
"Anyone For Icecream?. ICECR (R&R; Ice Cream Plc) was introduced in iTraxx Crossover Series 22 a year ago. Since then, its 5 year risk premium has almost only known one way: tighter. It touched 400bps on October 2nd 2014 and never looked back, moving to the 150-220bps range where it seemed to belong since early April. The final stage was reached today when NESTLE( Nestlé SA ) announced that they are discussing with PAI, ICECR’s owners, to create a joint venture that would operate in 20 countries with activities encompassing ice cream and frozen food. That was great news for investors who own risk in ICECR as its risk premium collapsed following the report. The 5 year CDS tightened 68bps to 170bps, and should soon be worth sub 100bps. But the situation also illustrates the difficulty in adding new and less liquid names to credit indices. In the most likely scenario, the “on the run” series of iTraxx Crossover will reference a name that is dead box and hardly trades for the next 6 months.
"
"Feeling Flat? Blame Commodities. The risk premium curves of investment grade credits are typically concave, with an inflexion point at 5 years. The curves are flatter on the longer end, and steeper at the shorter end. Curves are also usually behaving homothetically, and the 10 year risk premium expressed as a percentage of the 5 year risk premium is usually a very stable number. But that only holds for “reasonable” moves, and whenever a name widens substantially it comes a point where the curve flattens (otherwise the long dated risk premia would imply a near certain default) and for the most extreme situation it even inverts. This is exactly what happened with the commodity related names (AALLN and GLEINT on the above grapple) and VW. These names explain most of the recent widening of iTraxx Main S24 (ITXEB24). They also explain why despite its moderate widening, ITXEB24 has not behaved like a typical investment grade credit. It has not steepened but rather flattened over the last 10 days. The 5 year 10 year risk premium curve of ITXEB24 has gone from 38bps (with a 5 year at 76bps) when the series 24 was launched to 34bps (with a 5 year at 86bps) yesterday.
"
"iTraxx Financials: Still A Good Tail Hedge?. The relative value between iTraxx Main (ITXEB) and iTraxx Financials Senior (ITXES) is one of the most scrutinised spreads. For long periods of time, it has been an indicator of the stress experienced by the market, because of the exposure of banks, which represent more than half of ITXES, to peripheral risks in general and to Greece in particular. Investors have used that spread (buying protection on ITXES and selling protection on ITXEB) as a hedge against systemic risk, and that is evidenced by the DTCC statistics which point to that position growing in size consistently in the buy side community. Investors have been used to seeing the risk premium of ITXES trading wider than the risk premium of ITXEB. But with the recent wobbles in commodity related corporates and in car manufacturers, ITXEB has caught up with ITXES, and today ITXES closed tighter at 82.5bps than ITXEB at 83.5bps. If people begin to unwind their so called tail hedges, that could only be the beginning of ITXES outperformance. 
"
"Will They Do It Again?. The reporting season has not begun in earnest yet, but DB ( Deutsche Bank AG ) made sure today that results are back among investors’ top preoccupations. The bank reported a preliminary €6.2bln loss for the third quarter and said it may skip its dividend. Investors tried to assess what that could mean to Additional Tier 1 notes, as capital shortages could also lead banks to miss some of their coupons. Because of DB’s history (they were the first institution not to call perpetual bonds during the GFC), they have always thought that it was more a possibility for DB than any other banks. So it is hardly surprising that, following the report, DB’s AT1 bonds were marked down a couple of points. And, even though it is not (as it stands) a meaningful credit issue, the 5 year risk premium of DB’s senior debt was also marked a tad wider. It closed 4bps wider at 97bps, and dragged with it the highest beta names.
"
"Panic Over. Today’s session was strong across the board with all credit indices closing tighter. In fact, it was only the continuation of what we have seen all week, during which the grind has been relentless. It seems that most of the bullish positions had been unwound into the end of September, and all market participants felt a bit too short risk. With positive vibes from the commodity space and Emerging Markets, with less negative noise from automakers which previously contributed to the negative sentiment, with an issuance pipeline that slowed ahead of the reporting period, with central banks confirming their accommodative stance, buyers of protection were few and far between. Credit indices have tightened as fast as they widened after the roll. While they were 20% wider 10 days ago, the new series (25 in the US, 24 in Europe and Asia) are now roughly trading at the level at which they were issued 3 weeks ago. 
"
"When Volumes Back Prices. Sometimes large swings in prices are blamed on poor liquidity and it is a topic that often surfaces in debates around high frequency trading. But sometimes large swings in prices result from information which have the potential to change the game. This is exactly what happened a few weeks ago in the automotive industry. The admission by VW ( Volkswagen AG ) that they fitted some diesel cars with “defeat devices” aimed at cheating emissions testing paved the way for outsized fines and rocked investors’ (and consumers’) confidence. Many reassessed their exposure to automakers in general and to VW in particular. Risk changed hands at a rate never seen before. During the 4th week of September, daily volumes were in excess of $800mln on VW’s CDS alone and they were still in excess of $425m the following week. When things are hotting up in creditland, the CDS remains the instrument of choice to shift large amounts of risk.
"
"On The Road Again?. The automotive sector had a tough month of August because of emerging markets related worries. This wobble was actually made look like a walk in the park by the rollercoaster that followed the emissions scandal which begun a month later with VW ( Volkswagen AG ) and eventually affected all the car manufacturers. Investors are still licking their wounds and the sector looked like it could stage a recovery, as risk premia steadly came back down since the beginning of October. But today the negative newsflow resumed, with disappointing statistics out of China, where, despite some tax breaks, car sales only rose modestly in September against the backdrop of a slowing economy. PEUG ( Peugeot SA ) was one of the most affected and saw its 5 year CDS widened by 11bps at 336bps, but RENAU ( Renault SA ), TTMTIN (Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc), and FIAT ( Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV ) all suffered.
"
"Unabated Risk Appetite. Today, DTCC published their weekly statistics regarding clients’ positioning at the end of last week. The picture is unchanged across the board, in the sense that clients kept adding risk on all indices like they did the week before. They added $0.8bln of risk on iTraxx Main, $1.7bln on iTraxx Crossover (so that they are now net long risk across all series), $6.1bln on CDXIG and $2.1bln on CDXHY. iTraxx Financials Senior is the only index family where clients are still short risk, but even there they actually halved their short risk position. Investors’ concerns regarding the weakness in global growth appear to be more than matched by their faith in the central banks’ activism. They are convinced that the FED will not hike prematurely, and that the ECB, the BOJ and BOC all stand ready to increase their stimuli if needed. It is therefore no surprise that the current environment of negative bases (the risk premia of the indices are tighter than the sum of the risk premia of their individual constituents) persist.
"
"Bakshish Backlash. TLIASS ( TeliaSonera AB ) has been embroiled in legal probes in Sweden, the Netherlands and in the US about licenses they bought in Uzkekistan back in 2007. The market has been aware of these issues for a while, but the situation took another twist this morning as after Muddy Waters published a report questioning TLIASS’s transparency about their Eurasian business. They could face hefty fines because of questionable payments in Eurasia, their ability to pay dividends could be jeopardized and their credit profile could be significantly impacted according to the report. Even though the company gave a reassuring statement saying that it is as “open and transparent” as it is possible to be regarding listing requirement and ongoing investigations, the 5 year risk premium was marked 41bps wider at 92bps. 
"
"NSINO: Rendez-Vous In A Week. So NSINO (Norske Skogindustrier ASA) eventually paid their 2015 bonds. The company has apparently decided to buy some time in order to find a suitable solution to manage their considerable debt pile. Their next maturity falls in May 2016, but once these junior bonds will have been paid, there will be very little cash to redeem other maturities. It is therefore no surprise that holders of longer dated bonds are mulling restructuring plans. A group of investors holding NSINO’s 290mln euros of senior bonds due 2019 allegedly met with the company to discuss a possible debt for equity swap. Holders of junior bonds due 2017 approached management with an alternative plan that included extending their claims until after 2019. The company is conveniently in blackout period ahead of its results on October 22nd. They should expect a grilling then regarding their intentions. But in the meantime, as their willingness to kick the can down the road was evidenced by the payment made yesterday, investors have steepened the risk premium curve of NSINO on the short end. The 1 year CDS closed today at 29pts upfront, 10pts lower than 2 days ago.
"
"A Grind Rather Than A Rush Tighter. Investors’ take on the market is fairly sanguine at the moment. That sentiment got an additional boost overnight with reports that the Chinese economy is slowing less than people feared. But it essentially feeds on the upcoming ECB meeting on Thursday, as the latest instances have not disappointed the market once in recent months. Expectations that Mr Draghi will deliver a dovish message are certainly high and credit indices are well offered across the board. They are now reaching levels that have proven resistant since mid-August, particularly iTraxx Main (ITXEB). Indeed the roll between series 24 and series 23 of ITXEB is worth 6bps, so today’s close of 78bps is only a couple of bps away from the 70bps level on which series 23 bounced repeatedly towards the end of the summer. That is why people generally expect the market to trade sideways during the next few sessions. We shall see whether the ECB gives the market the impetus to go through these technical levels or if credit risk premia decide to bounce of them.
"
"So Predictable?. For a trade, the credit investors are selling protection, adding risks, to benefit from the market friendly ECB. The ECB convenes in Malta the next 2 days. It is supposed to deliver more QE. In conjunction, tomorrow is the monthly expiry for the credit index option market. Both factors are supportive to the credit index market. At the same time, there is a bid for single name credit default swaps. As a consequence, the basis, the difference between the index and the cost to replicate it with single names, is stressed. The investment grade basis is closing at -30cts (-6bps) in Europe and   at -40cts (-8bps) is the US, when both indices are trading around 80bps. That is respectively 7.5% and 10% returns that investors are losing in trading credit indices rather than trading the single names. This is the price for liquidity or a herding effect. We should to be cautious post option expiry, tomorrow at 4 pm. If investors start to think about the market positioning and the index basis, we could have some repricing. 
"
"Is It Free Money?. The debate around interest rate in the US has been fairly intense since the beginning of the year. “Will the FED or won’t the FED raise interest? And if they do, at which pace will that happen?” has been the (many many) million-dollar-question. But for people willing to make some extra bucks on their short term liquidity, there might be an opportunity. Similarly to what happened the last few years, entering the last quarter does not only mean Thanksgiving is drawing dangerously close, it also means US debt ceiling drama. November, 3rd has been set by Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew as the probable date when the US government may no longer be able to cover its expenses without Congress boosting the debt limit. That rocked the Treasury bills market as investors backed away from securities considered at risk for potential payment delays. That also impacted the risk premium of the USA. While the amount traded are irrelevant compared with the Treasury debt market, the 5 year CDS went up from 15bps to 27bps, and the 1 year CDS went from 5bps to 55bps. Carry, anyone?
"
"More Would Probably Not Have Been Reasonable. The ECB conference gave a big boost to the market today. All risky assets benefitted from the dovish tone of Mr Draghi. Barring effectively pulling the trigger on more QE right away, he could in fact not have been more dovish. He met all market expectations regarding further policy easing as he mentioned expanding the Central Bank’s asset purchase programme and possibly lowering interest rates further. As it stands, people were led to expect at the next ECB meeting, that will take place in December, an increase of the monthly pace of QE (possibly to €70bln from its current rate of €60bln), an extension of the length of the programme (possibly to December 2016 from the current September 2016 scheduled maturity), and a nudge to the deposit rate that will push it further into negative territory possibly at -0.30%. Unsurprisingly the reaction to these potential measures was most felt in Europe, and iTraxx Main which went through technical levels (and closed at 74bps) is now trading 6bps tighter than CDXIG in the US.
"
"What You Do, I Can Do Too. Usually when indices have a large move in the afternoon (like it happened yesterday), single name CDS are left a bit behind. They are a slower to adjust as they do not necessarily all trade at once, and the new situation is only fully reflected in their prices once trading has taken place in all the sectors. That is why bases (the difference of the quoted price of an index and its theoretical price computed from the prices of its constituents) closed at extreme negative levels yesterday. They usually adjust during the following session. But today, as part of their plate spinning challenge with the ECB, the PBOC stepped up their monetary easing and announced their 6th interest rate cut in a year. That led to a fresh round of protection selling on credit indices, and the single names, which were still playing catch up with yesterday’s price action on iTraxx in Europe and CDX in the US, were left with more ground to cover. In the end, at the close, index bases were as negative as they were yesterday!
"
"From Russia With Love. Emerging markets have been put under pressure this year, and Brazil has been attracting headlines for all the wrong reasons. Its economy is shrinking, its inflation is quickening and its currency is weakening. But analysts expect smartphone penetration and mobile data use to grow by at least 10pct this year, and many expect some sort of consolidation in the sector. So when Oi published a statement saying that LetterOne, owned by Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman, could inject $4bln in the company subject to a business combination with TIM Brasil, it did not come completely out of the blue. The timing came as a surprise though, and PORTEL’s (Portugal Telecom) 5 year risk premium collapsed 10pts tighter first thing this morning to finally close 6pts tighter at 24.25% upfront (+500bps running) after TITIM ( Telecom Italia Spa ), the owner of TIM Brasil, said they intend to pursue a Brazilian strategy of their own and have no plan to begin talks with LetterOne. Still, the tightening reflects observers’ view that a combination of Oi and TIM Brasil would make sense for all parties, and that LetterOne’s capital injection would meaningfully improve Oi’s credit profile.
"
"STM: Joining The M&A Bandwagon?. Technology has always been a fertile ground for M&A; activity, but it was not until this year that chipmakers embraced dealmaking at a record pace. $76bln in mergers and acquisitions have been announced by makers of semiconductors since the beginning of the year, as people seem to think that they should either exit the sector or get much bigger. STM ( STMicorelectronics NV ) is no different from its competitors, and it has struggled to generate consistent profit amid waning personal-computer demand and competition from rivals such as Texas Instruments Inc, but also from Apple Inc or Samsung Electronics Co which increasingly build their own parts. On its side, Fairchild, one the oldest chipmakers in the US, was reported earlier this month to have hired Goldman Sachs to help it find a buyer, which sent its stock up more than 20% over the last couple of weeks. That could be no deterrent to STM which were rumoured today to mull a bid, but as Fairchild is now a $2bln company, investors sent STM’s 5 year risk premium 20bps wider at 105bps.
"
"Another Day, Another Probe. Fraud is a risk that cannot be modelled and is what can make credit a really asymmetrical asset in the most extreme instances. It is always damaging for a company’s image and leaves analysts questioning the reliability of the information they are given. But more often than not, when fraud is revealed at a company, it only represents a dent in the representation of the 5 year risk premium over time. It can be a really severe one like for VW ( Volkswagen AG ) this summer when the emissions scandal surfaced, or a milder one like for TSCO ( Tesco Plc ) last fall. At the moment, it looks as if the widening of IBM’s ( International Business Machine Corp ) 5-year-CDS will be contained following the disclosure yesterday that the SEC is looking into the accounting treatment of certain transactions in the US, the UK and Ireland. Apparently accounting for emerging technologies can be challenging, and so far investors have decided to (sort of) give IBM the benefit of the doubt, only pushing the 5 year risk premium 15bps wider at 59bps.
"
"Chips On The Menu… Again. The semi-conductor industry has been all over the news since the beginning of the week. After STM ( STMicorelectronics NV ) bidding for Fairchild on Tuesday, NXP ( NXP Semiconductors NV ) grabbed the headlines today, as they reported Q3 earnings. Although they announced revenue just below and EPS above the street consensus, people focused – as one would actually expect them to do - on the guidance for the coming quarters. The company surprised the market by lowering their forecast for fourth quarter revenues (which they expect to be down “low to upper teens range” quarter on quarter), as customers pulled back on orders amid a slowing global economy and higher inventories of unsold chips. The surprise did not come from the direction of the revision, but rather by its magnitude. The stock was first to react and was marked down almost 20%. The 5 year CDS was slower and only moved 12bps wider to 165bps. There is still time to reload shorts on a name that used to belong in the 200/250bps range.
"
"BAT Ready To Break Up ImpTob?. When BATSLN ( Britisn American Tobacco Plc ) published their results yesterday, It left both their stock and their 5 year risk premium largely unaffected. In the eyes of investors, increasing volume made up for a negative currency impact which explained the 6.5% revenue fall. But today, BATSLN’s 5 year CDS was pushed 7bps wider at 42bps by growing speculations that they could be mulling a bid for IMTLN ( Imperial Tobacco Group Plc ). A press article reported that the company had been working with a couple of banks on a “break-up bid for IMTLN that would value the third biggest tobacco group at GBP48bln. Regulatory hurdles in order to comply with stringent competition commission rules will not be easily cleared though. That was reflected in the price action of IMTLN’s 5 year CDS which, after an early 10bps tightening, closed only 2bps tighter at 80bps.
"
"Are Emerging Markets back?. Despite all the negative press, sovereign CDS are still a very active compartment of the credit derivatives market. The heat map depicting the magnitude of the move and the amount of trading that takes place is usually largely correlated with the amount of coverage that each country is getting in the press. It is therefore no surprise to see that Turkey, with an average of $623mln traded each day last week, was the most active sovereign CDS. It occupies the biggest square. Following the outcome of the week-end elections that saw Mr Erdogan’s party swept back into office in the second parliamentary vote this year, ending months of political deadlock, it is also no surprise that it has one of the brightest shades of green in the sector. It was one of the strongest moves of the day, and Turkey’s 5 year risk premium tightened by 16bps to 238.5bps. That said, it was almost 30bps tighter at some point during the session, and investors decided to fade the move throughout the day. Like with other Emerging Markets, people are feeling a bit more comfortable, but worries have not completely gone away. 
"
"Catching a falling knife. Because credit indices are trading at levels that we have not seen since the beginning of August, some people begin to call a bottom (in risk premium terms, so a high in cash price). And recently 300bps on iTraxx Crossover S24 5 year (ITXEX524) and 70bps on iTraxx Main S24 5 year (ITXEB524) had provided some kind of floor in creditland. But today cracks appeared, especially on ITXEX524, and protection felt well offered despite the fairly thin liquidity. Arbitrage attempts (people trying to take advantage of the difference between the quoted value of credit indices and the value implied by their constituents) failed during the day when people tried to buy index protection and sell protection on single reference CDS, which means that the single name market will not slow down the index tightening just yet. Credit indices could be on their way to even tighter levels.
"
"Reality Check In Creditland. After a run of a few days with bases (ie the difference between the quoted value of credit indice and their theoretical value computed from the prices of their individual constituents) at extreme negative levels (the risk premia of indices is lower than their theoretical risk premia), we eventually had a correction today. On the one hand, credit indices stabilised (despite a very strong start which was later thwarted by Mrs Yellen’s comments who once again pointed to a December hike), and on the other hand there was a broad based repricing of single names risk premia. For instance, this reality check (risk premia had been maintained artificially wide in thin trading) brought the fair value of iTraxx Crossover 6.7bps tighter while the index closed 4bps wider. This sound price action does not necessarily mean the market is ripe for a correction as, during the recent rally, it never really felt like investors holding short risk positions capitulated, but at least risk will change hands more easily.
"
"QE Induced Compression?. Like every other first Friday of the month, tomorrow will see the release of the NFP (change in the nonfarm payroll) in the US. People use that as an excuse today to largely remain on the side lines and volumes were definitely subpar. Even if the market is pausing for thought at the moment with credit indices roughly unchanged across the board, there is no point in denying the strength of the recent rally. The results of the reporting season may have played a part, but that move was largely driven by Central Banks actions (one should probably rather say talks at the moment) around the globe. During the most recent period, there is another striking feature of the market. iTraxx Crossover has compressed materially against iTraxx Main. This has been a constant theme when QE expectations are raised in Europe. But the recent woes of a number of investment grade companies (VW among them) certainly did not help either.
"
"Closer to the hike, the CDS market is puzzled. With a 70% probability of a rate hike in December, with 2 year Treasuries trading at the highest of the last five years and with more than a percent drop in the euro-dollar, what is the reaction of the CDS market ? None.... The CDS market was rather puzzled.  Like  most Friday, the market was little active today. Only a few protection have been bought into the close. Looking at the DataGrapple heat map on the daily variation of the single name CDS,  we see an under performance of the  emerging sovereigns and the mining sector. This should remind us August but the conviction is fine.
"
"Sovereign Concerns Back In The Frame. Are we about to enter a period of renewed concerns about sovereigns? That was certainly what the market was trying to assess today. There was news over the week-end that Portugal could enter a period of uncertainty. Portugal’s socialist party approved a plan to join forces with three other left wing parties to oust Mr Coelho’s new administration. Whether this agreement could lead to a new coalition government is unknown, and how much could be given up to the Left Bloc and to the Communists is anybody’s guess. These mounting concerns led investors to send Portugal’s 5 year risk premium 26bps wider to 196bps. Despite recent polls showing a waning support for Podemos, thus reducing the probability of a “market unfriendly” outcome in the December’s election, Spain’s 5 year risk premium widened in sympathy and closed 3bps wider at 91.5bps
"
"The More Boring The Better The Performance. The recent macro led rally coupled with inflows into HY funds already sitting on high cash balances in a market that struggles to offer meaningful secondary liquidity led to a decent amount of credit index (iTraxx Crossover – ITXEX - in this case) being sold. This has led to ITXEX outperforming HY cash and single names, creating a large negative index basis (ie difference between the quoted value of ITXEX and its theoretical value). Arbitrageurs are on a mission to bring this basis back to zero, and they have been consistently selling protection on single names over the last couple of months. Dealers can recycle CDS on high to mid beta names fairly easily, as their perceived idiosyncratic risk generates decent liquidity and 2 way flows. But for the most boring names in the index, arbitrage led enquiries represent the bulk of their business, and the question rapidly becomes for them: “how short risk can I be on Trionista (or Unilab, or Sol Melia, or Techem, or Convatec) given that I do not expect technicals to change any time soon?”. With the risk appetite in the dealer community running at an all-time low, the answer is “not very”. The CDS risk premia of these names have collapsed and is now largely uncorrelated to their fundamentals, and disconnected from other asset classes, particularly bonds. Credit index basis can generate all sort of bases.
"
"Same Old Same Old. With the US closed today for Veterans’ Day, it was a quiet session which gave us the opportunity to take a step back and look at what happened since the beginning of the month. It is fair to say that there were decent moves, most of them taking risk premia wider (on the above Grapple, the bigger the box, the larger the volumes were, and the brighter the color the more pronounced the moves were). But the rationale behind them is the same that has driven spreads for a while. On a background of pale green shades, the brighter red boxes are linked with Emerging Markets, Cars, and commodities. The same themes are still driving the price action and the market seems to be struggling for new ideas.
"
"$75Bln Going Unnoticed. Yesterday ABIBB ( Anheuser Busch Inbev SA ) made a formal $107bln offer to buy SABLN ( SABMiller plc ), sealing a long anticipated deal that combine the world’s biggest brewers to form a company that will have the number one or two position in 24 of the world’s 30 biggest beer markets according to analysts. To back the acquisition, ABIBB said it obtained the biggest corporate loan on record, $75bln. In the future part of the loans will be replaced by bonds, and the brewer is said to be planning to sell $55bln of bonds across multiple currency and maturities. When it happens, this sale will also be a record. It will exceed the $49bln of bonds that VZ ( Verizon Communications Inc ) issued two years ago to fund its buyout of VOD’s ( Vodafone Group plc ) stake in a wireless venture. But while in September 2013, VZ’s 5 year risk premium jumped 30bps from 70 to 100bps when the jumbo deal was announced, ABIBB’s 5 year risk premium hardly moved at all. It widened today by 2bps to 81bps, which is merely in line with the rest of the market ( iTraxx Main, the barometer of European investment grade credit, widened 3bps to 73.5bps).
"
"Could Nuclear Prove Toxic For TOSH?. TOSH ( Toshiba Corp ) used to be a very “boring” credit. Until mid-2015, it was only moving with market. But that all changed in April this year when the industrial group started to get embroiled in a widening accounting scandal. Things got another a turn for the worst today when reports surfaced in the Japanese press questioning how TOSH booked losses at its nuclear power operations - Westinghouse – over the 2012 and 2013 fiscal years. Even though the company issued a statement to defend its disclosures, the reports definitely undermined further investors’ confidence. An analyst summed up the situation when he wrote “the risk to us is that there was more skeletons in their closet”. TOSH’s stock is now down more than 40% year to date, and its 5 year risk premium has more than quintupled from 50bps at the beginning of the year to 270bps at the close today.
"
"Novo Banco: There Is Such Thing As Positive Stress. On Saturday, the ECB published the results of the stress tests performed on some Portuguese banks, including BESPL (Novo Banco SA). The bottom line is that BESPL did well under the baseline scenario where it met the 8% capital requirement with a CET1 ratio of 8.24%, but failed under the adverse scenario, where it fell short of the 5.5% CET1 hurdle by €1.4bln with a CET1 ratio falling to 2.4%. To address the shortfall, BESPL will work on RWA reduction (it already stood at €3.5bln at the end of H1 2015 filling €187mln of the shortfall), work on asset sales (the sale of GNB Vida could on its own bring €400mln to €1bln, even if the high estimation is probably a bit fanciful), and the remaining part of the equity injection should then come from whoever eventually buys the bank from the resolution fund once the sale process resumes. Investors still await the exact details of the capital raising, but as their expectations regarding the stress test shortfall had steadily raised since the beginning of November, the 5 year risk premium got back exactly where it was back then and tightened 157bps to 613bps.
"
"Strong Like A Bull. Yesterday was extraordinary range bound with iTraxx Crossover(ITXEX) and iTraxx Main (ITXEB) staying in 4bps and 0.5bps corridors respectively. A weak open spurred on by soft trading in Asia and slumping oil prices gave way to a firmer tone as credit? tracked European and US equities off their lows. While the tragic events in Paris certainly did not help sentiment to begin with, analysts pointed out that the consequences on financial markets of terrorist attacks tend to be limited and short lived. This resilience in the face of terrorist activity was confirmed today and credit climbed steadily throughout the session to close at the tightest levels of the day. Indices could make a pause tomorrow though, as they are fast approaching on both sides of the Atlantic important strikes (70 for ITXEB, 300 for ITXEX and 80 for CDXIG) which could prove sticky during what will be an option expiry session.
"
"How Did They Do It?. This morning, DTCC published their weekly statistics regarding volumes and open positions on single name CDS and credit indices. If the increase in long risk positions on iTraxx Main ($3.4bln across the 8 most recent series and $3.1bln on series 24 alone) is consistent with market sentiment and the observed bases (ie the difference between the quoted value of an index and its theoretical value derived from the prices of its constituents) which are turning more and more negative (iTraxx Main’s quoted risk premium is tighter than its theoretical value), the numbers were a tad more surprising on the other credit index families. They all show an increase in short risk positions, and in the case of CDXIG a substantial decrease ($4.5bln) in long risk positions. With such results, one would expect index bases to creep higher, but they remain stubbornly stuck at their most negative levels. On CDXIG, the basis (which stands at -49cts or 10bps) is now worth well in excess of 10% of the index risk premium (which stands at 82bps).
"
"Going Their Separate Ways. The FOMC minutes released yesterday confirmed that the Fed are still on course to raise rates in December. Specifically, it was noted that “while no decision has been made, it may well become appropriate to initiate the normalization process at the next meeting”. Based on the Fed fund future market, the probability of a hike stands at 68%, but hardly anyone doubts that will go ahead. That is in stark contrast with expectations regarding the ECB next course of action. QE expectations in Europe are as high as they have ever been and investors are bracing themselves for a salvo of new easing measures mid-December. It will be the first time in a long long while that central banks in Europe and in the US embark on radically diverging paths. These contrasting environments are being played by credit investors, and some today were buying protection on CDXHY in the US while selling protection on iTraxx Crossover. Generally speaking, relative values are being played and it is obvious for all to see on the above grapple. While CDXIG and iTraxx Main (ITXEB) were trading 1bp apart at the beginning of October (at 96bps and 95bps respectively), they were trading 7bps apart early November (at 78bps and 71bps respectively) and stand 12bps apart at the close (at 84bps and 72bps respectively).
"
"Getting Ready For Thanksgiving. It was a quiet session to end a pretty strong week. Credit indices reversed today a portion of yesterday’s weakness. They felt relatively offered all day, and spent most of the session in a fairly tight range. Investors were busy trimming unwanted hedges and were squaring position ahead of the week-end, knowing that they should expect thinner liquidity in the coming sessions as Thanksgiving will cut the last part of next week. As a result, credit was somewhat immune from the broad price action in risky assets which proved quite volatile. People still have the next ECB meeting in sight, but given the extreme levels of the bases across the board, there might be more to gain on single names than on indices.
"
"Commodities Hurt. At the very end of last week, commodity prices rebounded somewhat and people were hoping for a pause in the recent downwards trajectory. The respite was short-lived though, and the march lower resumed today. There were broad based losses across much of the metal space. Mining companies are hit by the slowing economic growth in China that cuts demand from the biggest commodities user and pushes metal prices lower. The measures they have announced so far to cut production have failed to convince the market. The US dollar gains, led by the expected Fed tightening in the coming weeks and which gained further momentum today, did not help either and also contributed to make the basic material sector the underperformer of the day.
"
"Credit Market Schizophrenia. Gonvarri is walking away from Abengoa SA. The company has no choice anymore and it is seeking protection from its creditors. The CDS is trading the recovery at 15% of the face value. There is more than 8 Billion Euros outstanding debt, some secured. This will be the first credit event in Western Europe since CODERE Fin LUXEMBOURG SA auction   the 9 October 2013.  Norske Skogindustrier ASA, the paper company from Norway, could follow in December.  This is a bad day for credit investors. The tone in the single name credit derivatives market was weak in Europe  and a lot of investors a selling risk. At the same time, the beta is pushing credit indices tighter. The basis, the difference between the index and the single names is the casualty of the day and a reflection of the market schizophrenia. It is closing at a level never seen since the global financial crisis.
"
"VW: Crisis Over?. VW ( Volkswagen AG ) said yesterday that they would be able to bring their diesel cars into line with European clean-air standards by updating engine software for most cars and by installing a so-called flow straightener tube for those with a 1.6-litre motor. VW said it will launch the repair campaign in January and should complete the recall by the end of 2016. The associated cost should run around €500mln. That is only a fraction of the money - €6.7bln - VW set aside to cover the cost of the scandal, and investors duly celebrated by sending VW’s 5 year risk premium 40bps lower to 183bps. VW has yet to come with a solution to comply with the stricter US emission laws though, and they still face major risks including fines by the US Environmental Agency and lawsuits by angry customers. There might still be a few more bumps along the road. 
"
"Could It Be Fund Flows?. The ranges were once again fairly tight today on all credit indices and volumes were thin on a ground, as one would expect when most Americans are enjoying a long Thanksgiving week-end. And once again iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) outperformed iTraxx Main. And once again the basis of ITXEX (the difference between its risk premium quoted value and its fair value computed using its constituents’ individual risk premia) was stuck at the recent lows. On Wednesday, HY Credit fund reported strong inflows for the sixth week running. At the same time, some individual corporates in the high yield space are experiencing some serious difficulties. Fund managers could well be selling protection on the diversified ITXEX to get exposure to the market until things calm down and they have more visibility regarding which names they should choose to invest their cash. Fund flows could go a long way towards explaining the deeply negative levels of the ITXEX basis.
"
"Telecom Italia On Orange’s Christmas Shopping List?. A few days ahead of the much anticipated ECB’s meeting, the credit market was resolutely quiet. The tone was resoundingly positive across the board, but flows in CDS were thin. There were a few active names though. In the energy sector, the convertible bonds issude last week by TOTAL ( Total SA ) brought a few buyers of protection for instance. In the telco sector, the rumour had it that ORAFP ( Orange SA ) would be considering to expand in Europe. ORAFP has struggled recently with waning sales and earnings in France as competition from lower-cost carriers has pushed call and data prices down, and that one of the option on the table would be a tie-up with TITIM ( Telecom Italia Spa ). While ORAFP’s 5 year risk premium was 5bps wider at 57.5bps, TITIM’s was 7.5bps tighter at 143bps.
"
"Linde : De L’Eau Dans Le Gaz?. Under the stewardship of its previous CEO, LINGR ( Linde AG ) sold non-core assets and refocused on industrial and medical gases, as well as building industrial plants. It looks as if these 3 sectors could experience headwind at the same time. With the oil-price slump, petrochemical customers are reluctant to order new plants. Industrial gas demand is weaker than previously expected. And the medical gas business in the US is the subject of government-mandated price cuts. These were the reasons put forward by LINGR’s management yesterday when they reduced their earnings target for the third time in a year. They expect operating profit to be between €4.2bln and €4.5bln in 2017, which is €300mln less than their previous forecast. On the back on that, return on capital employed should remain essentially flat until 2017. Investors were not impressed, and they sent the stock 14% lower. Even the 5 year risk premium which was once extremely stable, gapped 7bps to 33bps.  
"
"Brazil!. It looks as if the risk premium of Brazil has eventually stabilised after a few rocky sessions. The 450bps level, which has (sort of) capped any widening attempt over the last couple of months, is proving difficult to break. That most likely helped the Spanish banks which have also stabilised.  The same cannot be said for RALFP’s ( Rallye SA ) and COFP’s ( Casino Guichard Perrachon SA ) which saw their risk premia widened today by another 29bps and 12bps respectively . RALFP keeps suffering from the continued weakness in Casino’s operations which are among the most exposed to Brazil headwind in the European corporate universe. PORTEL (Portugal Telecom) has actually been the most impacted and its 5 year CDS, which is quoted upfront (the perceived credit risk is high enough for investors to ask to be compensated upfront when they accept to provide insurance on PORTEL’s debt), is back to its widest level ever at 36.25% + 500bps running, as bonds were trading down 6 to 10 points. 
"
"Santa Did Not Show Up At The ECB Meeting. When people came into the office this morning, the level of expectations regarding the ECB’s meeting could hardly have been any higher. Investors were expecting a lower Deposit Facility Rate (-10bps to -0.30%), an extension of the QE program, and an increase of the amount of bonds the ECB buys on a monthly basis. They got a lower rate. They were a bit disappointed with a 6 month-extension of the QE program to March 2017 when some were expecting June. And they were not offered any amount increase, as the current rate of €60Bln a month will be maintained for now. The market reaction, which was muted in the first place, rapidly turned sour and risky assets got battered across the board in Europe. European equities closed 4% lower, credit indices closed well off their tightest levels (iTraxx Cross at 302bps and iTraxx Main at 73.5bps). Part of the recent outperformance of European indices compared with their US counterparts was handed back in the process.
"
"Pause For Thought. After the big moves experienced by the markets yesterday, today’s session was all about consolidation. The NFP published early in the afternoon only served to comfort people in their belief that the FED will hike the rates at their next meeting and they did not bring an awful lot of new information. As you can see on the above grapple, most credits traded sideways and there was no follow through of yesterday’s sell-off. This sell-off does not necessarily means that being long risk is not the correct trade at the moment, but it certainly is a reminder that being long risk at the current levels, when the main reason to be so is to rely on the ECB to “over deliver”, is a dangerous proposition.
"
"I Won’t Take “No” For An Answer. During the week following the release of the NFP statistics in the US, there is usually a lull in terms of economic number release.  It is therefore no surprise that a good deal of attention was paid to the comments made in New York late on Friday by Mr Draghi. Following the lukewarm reception by the markets of the ECB’s set of measures last Thursday, he felt the urge to be much more forceful during his NY appearance. Even though he said they were “not a package meant to address market expectations”, his assurance that “there cannot be any limit to how far we are willing to deploy our instruments, within our mandate”probably was. And that worked! European credit indices are grinding back to the tighter end of their recent trading range.
"
"Commodity’s Rout. With oil trading at a multi-year low and failing to stabilise following OPEC’s chaotic meeting on Friday, commodities have been front and centre recently. Things accelerated somewhat today in creditland, and all the red squares in the above Grapple (ie names which saw their risk premium increase during the session) represent commodity or emerging market related names. In Europe, the main casualty was AALLN ( Anglo American Plc ), despite announcing some balance sheet protection measures during their Capital Markets Day. AALLN will suspend its dividend, intends to proceed with additional divestments (including the phosphate and niobium businesses), and will reduce capex. But that should not be enough to prevent the leverage from rising to almost 3x sometimes in 2016, up from 2x in June this year. With many analysts still wary of more downside risks to commodity prices, the investment grade rating of the company appears seriously at risk. The 5 year risk premium closed 57bps wider at 832bps.
"
"Cool As A Cucumber. Over the last few sessions, credit indices have been on a widening path. The ECB meeting and the following press conference last Thursday signalled the end of the move tighter that we saw since early October. Since then, Emerging markets and commodities have taken centre stage again, and they have meaningfully impacted a few credits. To name a few, in the basic materials sector for instance, the 5 year risk premia of Anglo American, Mittal, Glencore are wider by 150 to 200bps since early December, and in the consumer sector Rallye and Casino saw their 5 year CDS widened by the same amount. To spice things up Abengoa and Norske Skogindustrier are on the verge of default. One could reasonably assume that investors have more than enough reasons to worry about the credit market. But they actually appear to be sanguine about the whole situation and are comfortable with their long risk positions on indices (which are still at record high level according to DTCC). Therefore credit indices are not moving any faster than what is implied by their constituents and bases (difference between an index quoted price and its theoretical value) are still resolutely negative. If a reach for index protection is due to happen before Christmas, it has certainly not begun.
"
"Can Accor Afford The Luxury To Buy FRHI. Yesterday, ACCOR ( Accor SA ) announced towards the close of the session that they were moving closer to buying FRHI, the owner of the luxury Fairmont, Raffles and Swissotel brands, for more than $2.5bln. ACCOR’s 5 year risk premium got initially punished, and it closed yesterday 10bps wider at 108bps. The deal was confirmed overnight for $2.9bln, but the company also announced that the purchase will be partly funded with the issuance of new stocks to FRHI owners, and that only $840mln will be paid cash. So despite a relatively soft tone in the credit market generally speaking (in an environment of resilient equities, so one can only wonder where credit indices will be trading if equity markets come under renewed pressure), ACCOR’s 5 year CDS risk premium closed 6bps tighter at 102bps.
"
"Climate Change?. It is difficult to point to a single catalyst as far as today’s sell-off is concerned. It was certainly broad-based and affected all risky assets. In creditland, as you can see on the above Grapple, hardly any name saw their risk premium close tighter today. The repricing was most severe in the US where the fair value of CDXIG25 widened by almost 7bps to close at 106.7bps. There was no game changing news, and the most affected sectors were the sectors which already suffered during the previous few sessions (commodities and EM related names). Poor liquidity definitely played a part, particularly in the cash market which was certainly not helped by the news that an $800mln mutual fund which is liquidating its holdings had to activate gates provision to be able to do so in an orderly fashion. Options on credit indices provided some respite in the widening when iTraxx Main approached 80bps and iTraxx Crossover approached 325bps as some deltas were adjusted, but that was only temporary, and risk premia are closing at their widest level of the day across the board (81.5bps on Main and 340.5bps on Crossover).
"
"Energy’s Wild Ride. Despite obeying slightly different rules regarding their composition, CDXIG525 in the US and iTraxx Main (ITXEB524) in Europe include roughly the same number of constituents coming from the energy sector: 19 for CDXIG25 and 20 for ITXEB24. There is a difference though. While most of these names are low beta in Europe (REPSM, the widest energy name, trades at 255bps and all the other sub 100bps), all the energy names in the US are high beta credits. Whatever timespan you select on the above Grapple, from 1 day to 6 months, you will see massive variations which reflects investors’ worries following the recent oil’s price rout. There is currently not a single US name belonging to the energy sector in CDXIG25 which has a 5 year risk premium lower than 100bps. Look at today’s wild ride, nobody expects it to change anytime soon, and that goes a long way in explaining why the credit index basis, which has corrected in Europe for ITXEB24 5 year (it closed at -15cts while it was worth -40cts a couple of weeks ago), is still stuck at historically stressed levels (roughly -70cts) in the US for CDXIG25 5 year.
"
"A Dovish Hike in the US After A Hawkish Ease In Europe?. After a six day losing streak, risky assets consolidated their fierce move over the last couple of days. They experienced a relief rally yesterday and stabilised today. That was certainly the case for credit indices, which were sticky around important strikes (80bps on iTraxx Main, 325bps on iTraxx Crossover and 90bps on CDXIG) of options maturing today. All eyes are now on the FOMC which is the only event left between now and the end of the year that can move prices significantly. But after recent news of redemption gates and liquidations among US and European credit funds which unsettled the market for a while, investors seem to have reached the conclusion that the FED will feel obliged to deliver a fairly dovish message should it hike rates tonight.
"
"Love You… Love You Not…. As recently as yesterday, COFP ( Casino Guichard Perrachon SA ) was receiving kudos from the market after announcing a new €2Bln deleveraging plan to strengthen its balance sheet, essentially through assets disposal in Vietnam and Asia. The news came as a relief to investors after a tumultuous 6-week-spell during which COFP’s 5-year-risk premium had been increasing relentlessly as fears surrounding the company’s Latam exposure were rising. But today, the company got slammed again after Muddy Waters Capital posted a report branding it a “highly levered hedge fund” and arguing that the debt-cutting plans “are not really deleveraging, but bailing out the chairman”. Despite many analysts reiterating their positive view on the company, COFP’s equity tumbled 12% (it was down 21% at some stage) and its 5-year-CDS was back to its widest level since the 2008 crisis at 375bps.
"
"Merry Christmas. It is quite likely that this grapple does not exactly depicts what most investors wanted to see, as the dominant colour is a bright shade of red. Even taking the carry and roll down into account, given the magnitude of the moves in a number of sectors, the widening of the risk premia means that a static investment in credit lost money on many names. The default of ABGSM (Agengoa SA) towards the end of the year, the vicious widening of many names’ risk premia (metals, miners, PORTEL or RALFP to name a few in Europe, drillers in the US) was a stark reminder that when you invest in credit, you have to be very selective as there is definitely some asymmetry in this asset class. 
This note of caution will be our last contribution until the end of the year, and the teams of Hellebore Capital Management and Cleared Derivatives Solutions both wish you all a very merry Christmas! 

"
"Happy New Year? Only If You Were Short!. First, we would like to wish everybody a happy new year! As far as markets were concerned, they did certainly not begin 2016 the way most were anticipating and certainly not the way most were expecting. Despite the stabilisation in oil, the fact that trading in Chinese equities was halted after they reached their limit down spooked investors when they arrived in the office, and all risky assets started on the back foot. Credit was a bit more relaxed than equities, but iTraxx Main and iTraxx Crossover closed 3.75bps wider at 81.25bps and 19bps wider at 334.5bps respectively, while CDXIG closed 2.5bps wider at 91.5bps and CDX High Yield closed 14bps wider at 491bps. To a large extend, it merely erased the performance of the last few days of 2015 during which credit indices saw their risk premia tighten in very light volumes. One can also argue that with bases at historically negative levels across the board (the risk premia of credit indices are currently around 10% tighter than their theoretical values), there is still room for further downside. But that is probably not what most people want to hear.
"
"Will Marks and Spencer Be Next?. After yesterday’s session which came as a shock to many investors, the price action was more muted in credit on much on the sectors. The odd one out was Consumer Cyclical though, and more specifically UK names, as NXT ( Next Plc ) gave the market a trading update which was a big miss from consensus expectations. This was clearly not a great start for non-food retailers, and it triggered some action straight out of the gate with people considering it has some negative read across for most of the sector. MKS ( Marks and Spencer Group Plc ), which will give its update on Thursday, was impacted and its 5 year risk premium closed 7bps wider at 113.5bps, while NXT’s closed 5bps wider at 59.5bps. But the most impacted names were to be found in the Crossover universe with MTNLN (Matalan Finance Plc) and NEWLOK (New Look Senior Issuer Plc) closing 110bps wider at 1890bps and 50bps wider at 436.5bps respectively.
"
"Arbs Print, Bases Resist. At the end of last year, bases (i.e. the difference between the quoted value of an index and its theoretical value computed with the risk premia of its constituents) made an attempt early December to normalise and tended to be less negative (index risk premia have been tighter than their theoretical risk premia for some time). That was short lived though and they were quickly back to historically negative levels at the end of 2015. Poor liquidity was blamed, as it was not allowing arbitrageurs to trade and collapse these bases. But now the market is fully open again, and arbitrageurs have been consistently buying protection on credit indices and selling protection on single names on both side of the Atlantic. It had no effect so far. On the back of poor sentiment towards risk, credit indices have seen their risk premia widen, but unabated pressure on commodities and recent worries around consumers have created an even larger appetite for protection in these sectors. 
"
"A Day Of Two Halves. Another poor session in China (although a very short one as it lasted a full 14 minutes before circuit breakers stopped trading for the day following a 7% rout) led to a weak opening in credit. Poor sentiment dominated all morning and iTraxx Main and iTraxx Crossover were stuck at 85bps and 350bps respectively. But once the US came in, new long risk positions were set via indices directly and via naked options. Combined with the news that China decided to suspend the stock circuit breaker rule, which has been singled out as one of the main factors behind the recent catastrophic equity trading sessions, it triggered a wave of short covering that brought credit indices to unchanged levels compared with yesterday’s close. Despite drifting wider towards the close, the tone was better at the end of the day. Well, that was true for indices, but once again appetite for single name protection ended unabated and indices’ fair values are still in excess of 10% wider than their quoted values.

"
"The Week That Was. An interesting week to kick the year off, even though probably not the one most were wishing for. There was no real new themes compared with last year with commodities and emerging markets still taking centre stage, and autos and consumers also keeping investors busy. The above grapple is interesting by its colour scheme, which is a reflection of brutal the move was on a large array of names. One should not read too much in the volumes as they relate to the last week of 2015, but there was an interesting statistics from the Bloomberg SEF. It shows that even though volumes are still a bit thin (the dealer reporting the most volumes transacted 6bln) which is not surprising given some people are still away from their desk, the competition among market makers is as fierce as ever: they were 7 to report roughly the same numbers.
"
"Is Kolh’s Shopping Itself Around?. We recently mentioned retailers as a sector under stress on both side of the Atlantic. Among them, department stores have been under pressure for a while. Shoppers now seem to favour stores that sell similar brands at deep discount and buy on-line. Their risk premia have massively underperformed the credit market over the last 9 months, and so have their stocks compared to the broader equity market. So much so that some are exploring new avenues. SHLD ( Sears ) has been selling off stores. M ( Macy’s Inc ) is talking with real estate developers to take over space in its flagship locations and other stores. According to press report published over the week-end, KSS ( Kohl’s Corporation ) would be debating whether going private could be an option. That certainly put a floor under its equity, but it only added to its debt holders’ woes. Its 5 year CDS shot up 53bps to 215bps.
"
"CDXIG: To 100 And Beyond…. The credit market felt bullish for most of the day in Europe. After a weak open on the back of another poor overnight session for commodities, protection sellers rapidly emerged as short risk positions set up during the previous sessions by the hedge fund community were trimmed. At some stage in the afternoon, after the US came in and the S&P; reached 1945pts, it felt like verging on capitulation. But with oil reaching new lows and flirting with $30/barrel, the mood quickly changed and credit indices went turbo bid into the close. That was true in Europe (Main went from 84bps to 86.5bps and Crossover from 345bps to 355bps), but the move felt even fiercer in the US with CDXIG going from 96.5bps to… 100bps. This energy heavy index is eventually the first of the investment grade indices to reach that threshold, and looking at its theoretical value (computed using the individual risk premia ot its constituents) which stands at 117bps, it could go much wider…
"
"Boring? No More. Oil has been one of the main drivers of risk premia over the last 9 months. It explains to a large extent the underperformance of US indices compared with their European equivalents, as both CDXHY and CDXIG include an important portion on high beta energy names. Since the beginning of the year, the oil rout has only got worse, and traditionally low beta names are feeling the heat in Europe. Today for instance, even when oil was off its lowest levels (it went up to $32 before going back to $30.5 at the end of the session) and Eurostoxx up 1.75% at the intraday highs, the risk premia of energy names (both oil and non-oil) were noticeably weaker and at the end of the session they make up the bulk of the worst performing names. After a torrid run since the first of January, it is quite striking to see that the likes of RDSA ( Royal Dutch Shell Plc ), STL ( Statoil ) or TOTAL ( Total SA ) are now trading at levels that were not even (or hardly) reached during the great financial crisis of 2008. Boring names will soon be a thing of the past!
"
"Volkswagen Part Deux?. It was just another day in credit market with commodity related names being slaughtered, when news emerged that RENAUL’s ( Renault SA ) offices had been raided by the French fraud squad last week. While shares of the company dropped 23%, RENAUL’s risk premium shot up from 120bps to 200bps, dragging the whole sector wider, as investors wondered whether something like Volkswagen part deux was about to begin. That initial reaction was eventually faded (the stock closed “only” 11% down and the 5 year CDS 28bps wider at 145bps), when people came to the conclusion that there rea reasons to think this investigation should be less damaging. On the one hand, officials conducting the test believe they won’t uncover defeating device according to RENAUL. On the other hand, RENAUL does not sell car in the US and should be spared the wrath of the Department of Justice, and it is difficult to imagine the French state, which owns 20% of the company, crushing a jewel of the French industry through punitive fines. So far, RENAUL has been less impacted by its own troubles than by VW’s 4 months ago. 
"
"Farewell Abengoa. Today’s price action in creditland was a tad less brutal than it was on stocks, but it was not a walk in the park either, and on the run indices registered their worst day since the beginning of the year. But during that nasty session, iTraxx Crossover Series 23 (ITXEX23) managed to close tighter on the day. There is a catch of course, and it was only due to the settlement of ABGSM’s (Abengoa) default yesterday – the recovery was set at 4.625% which means debtholder were almost completely wiped out. This settlement means that ABGSM has effectively been removed from the index, and this morning people begun trading version2 of ITXEX23. When it was issued, ITXEX23 included 75 constituents, each weighting roughly 1.33%. ITXEX23 has a 4.5 year residual maturity, so removing a constituent with a risk premium that was close to 100% improve the risk premium of the index by 1.33%/4.5=30bps. All taken into account ITXEX23 is effectively 20bps wider on the day, which is consistent with what can be seen the grapple graphing ITXEX24.
"
"Financials? Safe Haven No More. The week picked up where we left it on Friday, with ongoing pressure across asset classes. Both Asian and European stock markets moved lower, and credit was firmly bid within the CDS space, ie risk premia were still on the rise. Despite the US holiday, the need for protection shown no sign of abating. The only change compared with what we have seen throughout the year thus far was that the safe haven status of the financial sector is beginning to falter. Within this space, protection for single names was well bid, focusing especially on Italian banks. This trend started back in late 2015, but it was exacerbated further today with headlines that the ECB will seek to toughen scrutiny on non-performing loans (NPL) management. Reflecting investors’ concern about lenders’ level of bad debt in the region, the market swarmed on the second tier Italian banks, especially MONTE ( Banca Monte Dei Paschi Di Siena ) which saw its stock close down almost 15%, and its risk premium surge another 35bps to 413bps. That fed to the rest of the space which was under pressure, and core banks and insurance widened alongside. 
"
"Casino: The Roller Coaster Continues. Slightly more than a month ago, S&P; published a full analysis on COFP ( Casino Guichard Perrachon SA ) confirming the company’s BBB- rating and Stable Outlook. It did not prevent its 5 year risk premium to jump wider during the subsequent weeks following Muddy Waters’ report, but at least investors thought the investment grade rating was safe for the time being. So it came as a shock when S&P; put COFP on Watch Negative yesterday. The review will be concluded within 90 days and may result in up to 2 notches downgrade. The timeframe is probably what worries investors most. Even if COFP has announced recently a large and transformational deleveraging program, asking any management to sell a few billions worth of assets within a few months at top valuations when they face a downgrade which risks the stability of the entire corporate structure is a stretch. COFP’s 5 year CDS benefitted today from the better sentiment towards risk generally speaking and it retraced part of Monday’s move, but the path of least resistance appear to be wider at the moment.
"
"Index Positioning Does Not Explain It All. Believe it or not, despite a 10bps widening of iTraxx Main (ITXEB24) - from 86bps to 96bps -, buy side institutions have (almost) not bought protection on that index last week. They only cut their long risk positions by the equivalent $0.4bln across the 8 most recent series. That probably goes a long way in explaining the stubbornly negative basis (the difference between the quoted value of the index and its theoretical value) of ITXEB, as investors rushed to buy single entity CDS on the energy sector. The reach for protection on oil related names was even fiercer in the US (the sector is whopping 85bps wider at 455bps in investment grade over the past 5 sessions). So fierce that even a reduction by a third of long risk positions in CDXIG – from $36.8bln to $22.9bln across the 8 most recent series – and a 12bps move wider – from 97bps to 109bps - did not prevent the basis to reach the most negative levels since the Great Financial Crisis. That trend only accelerated today, and the basis of CDXIG25 stood at almost 1% at the European close.
"
"It’s Thursday, It’s Mario Day. Positive sessions for risky assets have been few and far between since the beginning of the year, and none produced any meaningful relief rally until today. Credit indices did not move much initially, but while single name protection still had a nagging bid despite CDXIG closing 3bps tighter compared with its level at the European close, both iTraxx Main (ITXEB) and iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) felt offered. The move tighter began after the ECB announced they decided to leave rates unchanged, and it gained traction once Mr Draghi begun his press conference. His dovish comments regarding a possible review of the ECB’s QE program which could happen as soon as March 16, combined with an improving news flow on financials with Italy expecting to reach an agreement with the EU over a bad loan vehicle and a rebound in oil price towards $30 per barrel, all contributed to a sharp rally into the close. All credit indices ended the session at their tightest levels, ITXEX at 378bps (-20bps), ITXEB at 94.5bps (-5bps) and CDXIG at 106bps (-8bps). Needless to say that single entity CDS were somewhat left behind (maybe they will catch up tomorrow?) and bases are still at historically stressed levels.
"
"Relief Rally. Today’s session only confirmed the tone that was set yesterday afternoon. Flows in CDS were heavily skewed towards better selling of protection, as investors cut hedges and added risk to their portfolio. This abated towards the end of the session though, particularly on indices which closed off their tightest levels of the day (iTraxx Main at 93bps, iTraxx Crossover at 369bps and CDXIG at 106bps). That meant that for once single reference CDS moved faster than credit indices correcting a (tiny) bit the level of the bases (which are still the equivalent of 10% of indices risk premia across the board, so still hardly in reasonable territory). Sectors that have been beaten up most since the beginning of the year rallied hard, most notably the oil and the auto sectors.
"
"Bye Bye USA. The march of companies abandoning their US citizenship to benefit from lower tax environments is showing no sign of abating, despite emerging as an issue in the US presidential race on which would be candidates from both side agree it should stop. Today JCI (Johnson Controls Inc) announced its merger with Tyco International Plc. Their headquarters will be based in Ireland, saving the merged company an estimated $150mln per year. It is not the only motivation for the deal though. JCI is a diversified auto-parts maker which is trying to reduce its exposure to the car market while expanding its building control system unit to become a multi-industrial business. The spin-off of JCI's automotive unit announced last year combined with today's merger will certainly put it closer to that goal.
"
"There Has Never Been A Better Time. Despite a poor start early in the session, oil managed to stage a rebound today, closing up almost $2 per barrel at $32.5. That certainly benefitted credit indices both in Europe and in the US and they are closing at their tightest levels of the day. It also helped the energy names included in CDXHY25 which have been battered recently. But after a poor session yesterday, mortgage insurers were weak once again. In the American High Yield space, there is hardly a day without a sector being asked serious questions and protection on single reference entities is left bid across the board. That has pushed the theoretical value of CDXHY25 close to 600bps, while the index itself is struggling to trade through the 550bps level and closed tonight at 525bps. This means that the basis of CDXHY25 is now worth almost 3%, a level which is very close to the most stressed reached during the Great Financial Crisis. More and more investors are looking at investing in basis trades and there has (almost) never been a better time to do it.
"
"Results Do Matter After All. Oil has grabbed most of the headlines recently, and it is fair to say that the ups and downs of the price per barrel of the WTI were responsible for a large part of the risky assets’ swings. So much so that it would be easy to forget that the reporting season is now in full swing. Ahead of the FOMC meeting tonight, credit has been generally trading sideways and the fair value of iTraxx Main and iTraxx Crossover in Europe, and CDXIG in the US only moved only moved marginally (+0.1bps, -2.4bps and +0.1bps respectively). A few names experienced wild variations though, among them TDCDC ( TDC A/S ). The Danish phone carrier reported earnings today. Cancelling the dividend - a move which triggered a collapse of the stock - to protect their investment grade status was not enough to reassure credit investors, who reacted to the revised earnings guidance – the company now expects EBITDA to fall 8.8bln kroner against market expectations of 9.2bln according to a Bloomberg analysts survey – and sent TDC’s 5 year risk premium 26bps wider to 145bps.
"
"A Bad Day If You Owned Bad Loans. It was another volatile day for oil with rumours of potential concerted cuts by Russia and Saudi Arabia which were later denied. At the end of the day, oil finished up almost $1 which benefitted energy names and made them the best performing sector among European credit. At the other end of the spectrum were financials. After the release of the Italian plan regarding non-performing loan, investors realised that unless transferring assets is mandatory and marks are severe (or maybe should we say fair…), then nothing really changes for the system. Bigger structural reforms will be needed to consider the issue over. On the back of that, the risk premia of Italian banks took a leg wider, dragging all financials with them. While the fair value of iTraxx Main was flat on the day at 104.3bps, the fair value of iTraxx Financial Senior was 2.3bps wider 93.1bps.
"
"Italians Are Not The Only Ones. In the world of Financials, last week and this one were mostly about non-performing loans at Italian banks and fears that the ECB would request further heavy provisions. But Italian banks were not the only ones to be under pressure. The above Grapple shows that the 5 year risk premium of DB ( Deutsche Bank AG ) experienced its most torrid ride of the last 3 years over the last couple of weeks, going from 100bps to 143bps. Ahead of the release of their results on Thursday, the fear of higher tail risk at the German bank pushed it wider as investors cannot take comfort from capital ratios that they consider a bit stretched. When they were published, the results did not really alleviate people’s worry as they shown a lack of profitability, with a noticeably underperforming investment banking division and a still heavy burden from litigations (CDS Antitrust among others). 
"
"Catch Me If You Can. Looking at the above grapple, it is not difficult to spot the odd one out. Over a one week horizon European indices are little changed… except iTraxx Financials Subordinated (ITXEU). It has widened by 20bps to 213bps (at one stage it was trading at 220bps during today’s session before a little snap back at the close). Switching out of corporate short risk positions into short risk Financials is a trend gaining momentum. Even if commodity and energy related names still appear sometimes vulnerable, they appear to have found a clearing level and two way flows have now developed as some investors are looking to book profits on a trade which has performed well since the beginning of the year. The same cannot be said for Financials. The repricing has just begun, and getting  some short risk exposure to Italian and UK banks and to DB is seen as an interesting opportunity. No one is willing to take the other side of the trade at present, and we could see ITXEU running away from the pack even more in the near future.
"
"What Happened To The Relief Rally?. The better tone that we had most of last week seems a distant memory, and with oil closing again on $30 per barrel, investors do not feel at ease. Buyers of protection were out in force in the CDS market. They targeted indices, but single reference entity CDS were also aggressively, primarily high beta names such as miners and commodity related corporates. Autos were also under pressure and reached new recent wides – even lower yielding names so their risk premia trade up with BMW ( Bayerische Motoren Werke AG ) and DAIGR ( Daimler AG ) both 6bps wider at 110.5bps and 98.5bps respectively – like FIAT ( Fiat Chrysler ) for instance. Despite the announcement by the company of sales numbers in the US which surprised on the upside (Januray sales growth was +6.9% vs -0.1% expected) which caused a knee-jerk tightening at midday, the name soon resumed its drift towards wider levels, caught in the general poor sentiment.
"
"It Is Still A Bear Grind. Credit indices have been weak throughout the session, and they were no different from all other risky assets today in that respect. The most striking feature of the move wider so far - over the last few days, but that is true since the beginning of the year - is that we have not seen any panic. Credit investors have not had their “coyote moment” yet, when they suddenly realise that they have gone over the edge and that they are hanging in the air. Some sessions have been brutal - iTraxx Main (ITXEB) widened by almost 6bps today and closed above 100bps at 104bps for the first time since 2013 -, but bases – the difference between the traded value of an index and the therotical value computed with the risk premia of its individual constituents - remain large across the board and it is still worth in excess of 50cts at the close on ITXEB. The latest DTCC statistics show that investors are still long risk on most indices. They are slowly bleeding in this steady bear grind.
"
"A Bright Spot During A Rough Session. It was a volatile session in credit. An early attempt to drive risk premia tighter was short lived and the march wider resumed swiftly for most part of the session, barring a brief spell of aggressive short covering when the US came in (which brought credit indices to almost unchanged levels from 4bps and 15bps wider for iTraxx Main and iTraxx Crossover). Miners and metals did not participate in the widening though. GLEINT ( Glencore Plc ) was downgraded to the lowest investment grade rating by S&P;, from BBB to BBB-, but most importantly their rating outlook is now stable. Investors breathed a huge sigh a relief and they sent GLEIN’s 5 year risk premium 111bps tighter at 840bps. It also benefitted AALLN ( Anglo American Plc ), MTNA ( ArcelorMittal SA ) and TKAGR ( ThyssenKrupp AG ) which all tightened meaningfully.
"
"Desperate Times Call For Desperate Measures. MTNA ( ArcelorMittal SA ) caught the market by surprise this morning. They released their results one week ahead of schedule, but above all they announced a $3bln capital increase alongside the sale of a $1bln stake in Spanish auto-parts maker Gestamp. The company aim to reduce its debt pile by $4bln to below $12bln from the current $15.7bln. That definitely added to the momentum gathered yesterday, and, if the prospect of a share placement weighted on the stock (it was down 12% at some stage before closing down 5.5%), the 5 year CDS received kudos from investors and tightened by 141bps to 836bps. MTNA’s 5  year risk premium is in excess of 250bps tighter over the last 48h. It is not that bad a performance considering iTraxx Crossover is 25bps wider at 425bps during the same 2-day period.
"
"Gotcha!. With oil trading once again  towards the lows, one would expect the energy heavy CDXIG – the US investment grade credit benchmark – to keep underperforming iTraxx Main (ITXEB), its European equivalent. In fact, the opposite happened and the reason lies with Financials. CDXIG does not include any banks, while ITXEB contains twenty one. This subset has been hammered recently, pushing iTraxx Financials Senior, which also include 9 insurers, almost 30bps wider to 135.5bps over the last couple of sessions. Investors fear the low rate environment could take a heavy toll on the sector. On top of that, the latest Brexit YouGov poll published on Friday showed a significant rise in support for leaving the EU – the net lead of those saying they would vote to leave increased to +9% - and gave the UK banks’ risk premia another kick wider. The move has been so violent that ITXEB, which was trading 14bps tighter than CDXIG a couple of weeks ago, closed tonight 1bp wider than the US benchmark (122bps vs 121bps) 
"
"Back To The Good Old Days?. iTraxx Crossover series 24 5y (ITXEX524) traded from 465bps to 447bps and then back to 461bps. And that was before most people had breakfast. The credit market calmed down a bit until lunchtime, but once the US came in, it was chaos again: ITXEX524 all the way up to 482bps before eventually closing the day at 461bps. It is an understatement to say that daily variations at the moment do not say it all. The volatility is intense and the volumes changing hands are substantial with $15.5Bln, $6bln and $5.7bln trading on iTraxx Main, iTraxx Crossover and iTraxx Financial Senior (ITXES) respectively. It is interesting to note that when a sector is in the spotlight then the trading activity explodes as evidenced by the intense 2 way flow on iTraxx Financial Senior. With the focus put on high beta European names since the beginning of the year, there is no doubt that the late iTraxx High Volatility index which was last issued in September 2013 (the most recent series is series 20 on that index) would attract some interest. Who knows whether we will see it make a come back…
"
"Compression Explained. Like every Wednesday, DTCC have released their weekly statistics regarding clients’ positioning in credit indices. Clients are now short risk on Financials like never before over the last couple of years. As of Friday, on the most recent 3 series of iTraxx Financials Senior, they were holding a net short risk position of $9.7bln, up from $8.0bln the previous week. That caution towards banks also translated into a reduction of clients’ long risk position on iTraxx Main (ITXEB) by $10bln, even though they are still long risk a healthy $19.3bln on this index. By comparison, long risk positions on iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) were only reduced by $400m to $2.7bln. That probably explains to some extent the compression that we have seen last week, as many observers noted the relative underperformance of ITXEB (+28bps on the week from 94bps to 122bps) compared to ITXEX (+89bps from 370bps to 459bps) using the standard ratio of 4. 
"
"Are PIIGS backs?. The market thought yesterday that the worst was over, after a couple of days of respite for Financials. This morning, despite a poor session in Asia to mark the beginning of the Chinese New Year, people were still discussing how far credit indices could retrace if a squeeze tighter was to happen. But soon, equities began to head south and oil resumed its march lower, which was the signal buyers of index protection had been waiting for. Credit indices were pushed to new recent wides and iTraxx Crossover only stopped a couple of bps short of the 500bps level. The reach for protection was aggressive, but when looking at bases (difference between the quoted value of an index and the theoretical value computed from its constituents) across the board, one cannot help feeling we have not seen proper capitulation yet. There was one difference with previous weak sessions though: peripheral names were under particularly pressure, especially Portuguese ones, as highlighted by the 62bps widening of Portugal sovereign CDS to 356bps. Could 2016 mark the return of PIIGS?
"
"Volatilty? Yes. Dislocation? Not So Much.. It felt quieter today - volumes were effectively down from previous sessions with $8.8bln traded on iTraxx Main (ITXEB), $3.7bln on iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX), $2.4bln on iTraxx Financials Senior (ITXES) - but mainly because investors were not whining as loudly as they are when risk premia are on the rise. Daily variations were as impressive as they have been all week, and they almost cancelled yesterday’s moves. Given all the noise that was made around banks and the intense pressure they have been put under - at some stage yesterday, DB’s 5 year risk premium was trading 70bps wider at 275bps compared with last Friday’s close -, it is amazing that ITXES is finishing the week only 5bps wider at 126bps – it traded at 138bps this morning! -. The volatility has been intense, but market dislocations have been contained. The main sign of stress that appeared was actually the basis of ITXES going deeper into negative territory.
"
"What Is The Market Pricing?. Datagrapple has made a series of new Grapples available: the Probabilities of Default (PD). They enable you to see, on a given maturity, the evolution of the cumulative default probability for a given name or a group of names (in that case the average PD is displayed). The interpretation of this indicator is fairly straightforward. If the PD of an entity over a 5 year horizon is 25%, then there is only a three in four chance that it will still exist after 5 years. On the above Grapple, you can see for instance that the average PD of the basic materials sector has been increasing steadily since July last year, and that the PD of the energy sectors has blown out since January. There is nothing really surprising there, but it might be more unexpected to see that the market is currently pricing for the different European energy national champions (BP, ENI, Royal Dutch Shell, Repsol, Statoil and Total) a one in three chance that they will default over the next 10 years.
"
"Is It The Downgrade?. Yesterday after the close, Moody’s junked AALLN ( Anglo American Plc ). While, a downgrade to sub investment grade was largely expected, the 3-notch move from Baa3 to Ba3 with an outlook which is still negative probably came as a surprise to most investors. That was not the only piece of news though, as AALLN also reported their 2015 full year results this morning. EBITDA is down 38% year on year on the back of the decline of commodity prices and net leverage was up to 2.7x at the end of December. Encouragingly, management increased their divestment target for 2016 to $5-6bln from $3-4bln, but many will question the feasibility of this ambitious plan in the current environment as buyers are few and far between. AALLN also ruled out a capital increase at this stage, and that is probably the main reason behind the 77bps widening to 1057bps of the 5 year risk premium (yes, if you check on our new Probability of Default grapple, it means the market only sees a 40% probability that AALLN will be a going concern in December 2020).
"
"Well Behaved. Today was the 4th session in a row of credit indices tightening. Europe has led the charge, driven by financials which are now well of their widest levels. iTraxx Financials Senior (ITXES), which was trading at 140bps as recently as last Thursday, closed tonight at 113bps. With iTraxx Main (ITXEB) and CDXIG closing tonight at 108bps and 117bps respectively, it is as if the few sessions where they traded on top of each other never happened. ITXEB is coming back to 100bps as fast as it went out to 127bps. Less than 2 weeks were necessary to cover these 50bps. But the most striking is how well behaved the market has been during this burst of volatility. Credit indices and single reference CDS have move in unison. Today for instance, the basis of ITXEB (the difference of the quoted value of the index and the theoretical value computed with the risk premia of its constituents) moved by less than 2cts during an index move of almost 30cts. The basis of ITXES moved by less than 4cts for an index move in excess of 35cts.
"
"That Was Weird. The close in the US yesterday was strong with new issues behaving very well and clients looking to add in the secondary market on the recent deals by Apple, Comcast or IBM. In Asia as well, the overnight session was supportive and credit indices closed a couple of bps tighter. So it all started with a constructive tone for iTraxx indices in Europe. Itraxx Main was wrapped around 106.5bps for the best part of the day and iTraxx Crossover wrapped around 425bps. The traditional high beta sectors like Autos or Consumers were all in the green, and AALLN ( Anglo American Plc ) contributed to the feel good factor by announcing a buyback of some of their bonds sending its 5 year risk premium more than 50bps tighter at 910bps. But an hour before the close, a few protection buyers emerged in the market, particularly on financials, and the sentiment turned very quickly. Risk appetite disappeared and liquidity became very thin. iTraxx Financials Senior traded up from 110bps to 120bps with no volume going through. It definitely raises questions about the recent leg tighter of the risk premia and the next few sessions will tell whether the rally was merely down to short covering or if a genuine appetite for risk is back in the market.
"
"That's Compression. When investors compare the moves of iTraxx Main (ITXEB) against the moves of iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX), they usually use a ratio of 4 for the current series of indices. If you play with the time span of the above grapple, you will see that this ratio roughly holds for any period since the beginning of the year. Not today. Investment grade names were indeed dragged by headlines regarding the Auto sector and Financials. Mercedes-Benz clean diesel models are accused in a lawsuit of containing a device that causes the vehicles to violate US emissions standards. Their owner DAIGR ( Daimler AG ) denied any wrongdoing and said claims of defeat device are baseless, but with memories of VW’s ( Volkswagen AG ) rollercoaster ride still fresh in investors’ memories, the whole sector’s risk premium was pushed wider. Jitters around banks came mid-morning after CS (Credit Suisse Group AG) was said to be probed in Italy for money laundering. Once again, as we said many time before in the recent past, moves never really felt panicky, but they were definitely enough to cause a meaningful compression between ITXEB and ITXEX, as both widened today by 3bps, to 113.5bps and 443bps respectively.
"
"Brexit? You will be Fine… Unless You Are British!. If some investors came in the office this morning all beared up following Boris’ announcement that he will campaign in favour of the “Brexit”, they must have been left bitterly disappointed. The most notable move was in FX, with GPB losing 1.8% against the USD, but in creditland, the reaction was sanguine to say the least.  There was not a single credit index which closed wider on the day. The same was not true regarding single reference CDS though, as a few constituents of iTraxx Main were wider. And yes, the vast majority were UK names, and most of them were banks. The poor results released by HSBC (HSBC Holdings Plc) this morning probably did not help - they missed on pretty much everything and raised questions on their energy lending book -, but UK banks are obviously the ones which stand to lose the most if the UK decided to go its own separate way.
"
"The Weakest Link. The last few days have gradually set the scene of a lower volatility environment as far as credit is concerned. This is slowly bringing confidence back to the market and we have seen a steady stream of protection selling across the board on credit indices over the last few days. Today credit indices significantly outperformed equities which were heading south in the afternoon while credit was barely moving. But the feel-good factor is not affecting all sectors indiscriminately, and Financials still appeared weak today. Yesterday HSBC’s (HSBC Holdings Plc) results disappointed investors, and today STANLN’s (Standard Chartered) did not fare any better and set the tone for banks, which underperformed the rest of the market. Even though Financials is still the most actively traded sector, liquidity felt challenging at times, and aggressive protection offers were few and far between.
"
"Peugeot: On Their Way To IG?. It was a risk off day across the board, but it was certainly the best “bad day” we had in a while and credit once again outperformed equities. The sell-off felt contained thanks to a good liquidity in all sectors. Of course, even though credit is closing off the day’s widest levels, almost all high beta names saw their risk premia increased, except PEUGOT ( Peugeot SA ). The company announced that it has completed its recovery plan “Back in the Race” one year in advance and that it has massively over achieved its targets with a €3.8bln operating FCF and an industrial net cash position of €4.5bln. A new plan, dubbed “Push to Pass”, directed at sustainable profitable growth will be presented with the 2016 at the beginning of April. Rating agencies will certainly want proof of the sustainability of PEUGOT’s comeback before they act, but investors appear to consider that a return to investment grade could be under way, and they sent the 5 year risk premium of PEUGOT 20bps lower to 281bps.
"
"Freefall. “LetterOne Technology has been informed by Tim that – whilst it thanks LetterOne Technology for its approach – it does not wish to enter into further discussions, about the facilitation of a merger between Oi and Tim in Brazil” LetterOne said in a statement. The plan laid out last October was for LetterOne to inject as much as $4bln in Brazil’s Oi – which is PORTEL’s parent company – on condition that the carrier merges with Tim. With no other obvious consolidation opportunities, given the level of debt that PORTEL has to deal with, the likelihood of a restructuring seems higher now. At the current rate of cash burn, something has to happen before the end of Q1 2017. The question is “what does the company decide regarding their bonds due in July 2016?”. Do they restructure before they come due? Or do they muddle through as long as they can in the hope of finding an alternative solution to the aborted Tim’s deal? Investors did not wait to punish the 5 year risk premium and sent it 15 points higher to 60 points upfront (to insure $1 of debt you need to pay 60cts upfront and then 5cts every year).
"
"A Month For Nothing?. Buyers of protection were nowhere to be seen today and it felt like a replay of yesterday’s price action on steroids. It looks as if investors do not want to hold large short risk positions going into the G20 meeting this week-end nor into the ECB meeting next month. The days where iTraxx Main and iTraxx Crossover traded above 127 and 490 respectively seem a distant memory. Even iTraxx Financials has regained some strength. The catalyst of the short covering in that space seemed to have been the results of LLOYDS yesterday, which put an end to the recent miserable string of earnings among financials. The credit market is trading at multi-week tights and recouped almost all its losses since the beginning of the month. Are all our troubles over?
"
"Valeant Default Risk on the Rise. Valeant CDS was not trading up to September 2015 while the company has more than 19BUSD of bonds outstanding. The CDS has been included as one of the 100 members of the CDX.NA.HY.25 credit index, the US High Yield credit index.  The CDS has started to trade with the only sellers of CDS protection being the index arbitragers.  The CDS movements have been rather erratic since September  like Valeant equity. Yesterday, with SEC investigation, Moody’s watch negative, the 5Y CDS indicates a 43% probability of default over the next 5 years from 34% the day before.  A default will add a lot of pressure on high yield investors who are already facing larges losses on the energy complex.
"
"No Credit Event on Banco Novo, S.A.. On 29 December 2015, the Bank of Portugal approved the transfer from Novo Banco, S.A. to Banco Espírito Santo, S.A. of certain senior bonds in a nominal amount of EUR 1.941m. While bond holders have lost 70% of their nominal in a day, the CDS investors were   worrying if their CDS protections  could work.  The ISDA EMEA Determination Committee (DC) has been asked if  the CDS would be triggered either using the 2003 definitions or the 2014 one.  The DC has eventually decided that a credit event happened on no account.   While the Portuguese government decision  was the best interest of  Portugal, there is definitively a loophole in the CDS definition to protect a specific exposure when the pari passu debt ranking is overruled.   The restructuring in Europe is  the largest challenge for the CDS definitions. Being a minority bond holder in Europe is as much a challenge...
"
"Brexit or not, give me your Euros. British Telecommunications (BT) launched successively its €3.9bn Euro emission today on three tranches: €1.5bn 5yr,  €1.1bn 7yr, €1.3bn 10yr. The 5 year tranche is paying a yield of 0.72%. BT CDS is indicated around 0.83% at market close. This is a positive basis situation i.e. the cost to insure the credit risk and the rate risk is higher than the yield provided by the bond. Flushed with Mario Draghi’s money, continental investors are investing Euro Area savings with little rewards versus the Brexit risk. BT revenues are essentially in the UK.  BT is only rated BBB by Standard & Poor’s. 
  
The last paradox is that BT will use the proceeds to finance its EE acquisition from Orange and Deutsche Telecom, more precisely to pay Orange 3.4BGBP in cash (DT was paid with 12% of BT shares).

"
"Energy Credit Full Steam. The attached grapple provides an impressive view on the strength of the recent credit rally. Over the last 10 days, the average CDS premium of US investment grade energy companies   - from Apache to Valero - has tightened from 4,25%  to 3,25%. We are trading back at early December levels.  Some technical factors like the coming  CDS roll in March can explain the squeeze. On March 21, the on-the-roll CDS contract maturity will increase by 6 months from December 2020 to June 2021. Investors are expected to unwind their credit hedges on the off-the-run contracts. But, the price action in the commodity market is the main driver of this movement. The oil is close to be flat on a yearly basis.  Having  found a floor on the oil price, the energy complex credit risk has quickly differentiated the survivors from the one which can not survive an oil in a 30-40 price range. A company CDS premium is a function of its assets volatility, less volatility on oil  will keep pushing credit premia lower on the the first set of companies. 
"
"All Eyes On The ECB. Investors were in panic mode 3-4 weeks ago. It is now a distant memory and the market has been regaining poise thanks to higher oil prices and better recent US data, but also on the back of building expectations of action from the ECB at its next meeting on Thursday. Like in December, the bar has been set pretty high for Mr Draghi. One of the measures people think will be announced is a further cut of the deposit facility rate to -0.4% from its current -0.3% level. If the rally gained further momentum today as the ECB’s meeting is drawing closer, one sector has been lagging: financials. Indeed, the market seems decided to price the negative impact of a lower deposit rate for banks into credit spread. Even though this event is arguably more likely to impact profitability rather than credit quality - in particular when the Central Bank is about to provide more liquidity -, protection buyers emerged on both iTraxx Financial Senior and iTraxx Financial Subordinated and made them the notable underperformers of the day
"
"The End Of Stress?. Since October last year, the credit quality of commodity related companies have been seriously questioned. It has been a worldwide phenomenon. In the US, the energy sector has been particularly affected, and with a barrel trading sub $30, the likes of DVN (Devon Energy Corporation), NBR (Nabors Industries Inc), WFT (Weatherford International Ltd) saw their risk premia go through the roof and trade in points upfront. The same was true for TCKBCN (Teck Resources Ltd) or FCX (Freeport-McMoRan Inc). The need for protection on these names was deep and for a couple of months, their CDS have moved much faster than did CDXIG, the index to which they belong. That pushed the basis (difference the quoted value of an index and the value computed from the prices of its individual constituents) to unprecedented negative levels. But since the beginning of February, commodities have sort of stabilised. Combined with the fast approaching roll (the date at which the standard 5 year maturity will be extended), it has dampened investors’ appetite for single reference entity protection maturing in December 2020. So much so that the basis which was worth 90cts on CDXIG24 5 years six weeks ago is now back to the 20cts area, where it belonged for the best part of 2015.
"
"They Are At It Again. Ahead of the ECB meeting tomorrow, it was a fairly quiet session in creditland and indices mainly traded sideways in a fairly narrow range. COFP ( Casino Guichard Perrachon SA ) was one of the actively traded names though. The company came once again under fire from Muddy Waters which published a report yesterday reiterating their view that Casino is using financial engineering to mask a sharply deteriorating core business and that their main shareholder RALFP ( Rallye SA ) has too much debt. That set the tone for a weak session, despite COFP announcing this morning that the first 2 months of the year in France were very good and confirming their full year 2016 guidance. More significantly to credit investors, during its earning release, the retailer dropped its commitment to investment grade rating, despite reiterating this just after S&P; put them under Credit Watch Negative earlier in the year. The 5 year risk premium finished the session 15bps wider at 385bps.
"
"Don’t Know What To Do With It? Sell It To Mario!. Those who expected the ECB to disappoint the market today were left… disappointed, at first anyway. Mr Draghi announced a set of measures that matched most of people expectations (all rates were lowered including the ECB deposit facility rate which was brought from -0.3% to -0.4%) and effectively surpassed them when he announced that the Central Bank purchase program will be extended to corporate bonds. It will begin to buy investment grade euro-denominated bonds issued by companies outside the banking industry in a month time. The news sent iTraxx Main (ITXEB) 12bps tighter on the day, when it traded down to 80bps. The European investment grade benchmark massively outperformed iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX), its high yield equivalent. At the close ITXEB was 7.5bps tighter at 84bps while ITXEX was 19bps tighter at 358bps, when the usual ratio of their respective moves is closer to 4. Even though credit indices closed off the tights, they experienced their best session since last summer. The situation were quite different for stocks which, after an initial very positive reaction (+4%) to the rates reduction, were left demanding for more after Mr Draghi suggested during its press conference that the bottom might have been reached on rates. Equities eventually finished the day almost 2% down, i.e. 6% off their highs. 
"
"The Tantrum Is Over. After reacting like a spoiled kid yesterday, the equity market rose steadily today and finished the day up 3% across Europe, more than making up for Thursday’s losses. As far as it was concerned, the credit market never looked back and followed the strong positive trend which was initiated yesterday, only with increased velocity. One has really to go back to the heyday of the Great Financial Crisis to find equivalent daily variations. Days where we have seen a 20% tightening of the risk premium of iTraxx Main (ITXEB) have been few and far between in the 12 year history of credit indices. Since February 11th, the risk premium of ITXEB has been roughly halved, moving from 126bps to 68bps. Investment grade benefitted the most from the move, once again outperforming iTraxx Crossover. Unsurprisingly, European credit also significantly outperformed US credit, and ITXEB closed today 16bps tighter than CDXIG which ended the session at 84bps, when the spread between the 2 was 9bps yesterday and 0 early February.
"
"Consolidation. The velocity of the moves in credit during the last couple of days of last week was nothing short of astonishing. And it seemed for a moment when the European markets opened this morning that the momentum could carry into today’s session. iTraxx Main (ITXEB) traded as tight as 66bps and iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) as tight as 298bps. But that move was actually short lived as soon buyers of protection emerged in the market, and the whole day was spent consolidating part of the trends seen Thursday and Friday. Credit closed wider across the board, underperforming equities which were flat to modestly up in all regions. While it had been the main beneficiary of the ECB’s action, ITXEB underperformed ITXEX (the latter widened by 6bps when a 17bps would have been expected based on ITXEB variation alone) and CDXIG in the US.
"
"Could Valeant Default?. Not long ago, VRX ( Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc
) was the darling of the Toronto’s stock exchange and one of Canada’s most valuable companies. Not anymore! Last October, questions arose after a report revealed VRX’s previously undisclosed relationship with Polidor, the Pennsylvania mail-order pharmacy. The company has since launched an internal investigation into the matter- last month, it said that it had to restate its financial results for 2014 and 2015 after finding that about $58mln of sales to Polidor were recognised at the wrong time -, and it has delayed filing its 2015 annual report with regulators until it is concluded. This potential late filing spooked the market as much as the fact that VRX slashed its guidance today. Indeed, such violation would theoretically allow VRX’s lenders to demand their money back sooner than originally planned and VRX would then face the prospect of defaulting on its debt. Its stock was halved (wiping out more than $10bln of market capitalisation) and its 5 year risk premium soared 170bps to 695bps.

"
"€12bln Can Buy You 6bps. Ahead of the FOMC meeting today’s session was a bit dull and the credit index option expiry failed to provide any excitement. The market is still consolidating its recent fierce move tighter and risk premia were up across the board. EDF ( Electricite de France SA ) was among the odd ones out. The company’s finances are under strain as falling power prices and rising competition threaten future earnings while it needs to spend €50bln to renovate French nuclear reactors over the next 10 years. Its chief financial officer recently resigned as EDF remains committed to an £18bln atomic-reactor project in the UK, which threatens EDF’s rating if it goes ahead without appropriate self-help measures. So it came as a relief to the market that they could be considering a €12bln capital increase, which is quite significant for a €19bln company. Other sources actually suggested that the “capital increase” would effectively come from cash savings of paying no cash dividend for 5 years. In any case, the news was welcomed by investors who pushed the 5 year risk premium 6bps tighter at 83bps. 
"
"My Credit Is Better Than Your Stock. The consolidation that took place over the last couple of days appears to be over, and the main themes that were at play just after the ECB meeting made a stunning comeback. The performance of credit compared with equities was outstanding. The Eurotsoxx was down 0.7% (notably hurt by a rising) while iTraxx Main (ITXEB) was more than 6bps tighter at 71.25bps. Investment grade credits also outperformed their high yield counterparts. The tightening of credit comes from the recent ECB’s actions and from yesterday’s FED statement (which pushed the CDXIG 8bps tighter at 83.5bps in the US), but unwinds of hedges before the roll that will take place next Monday certainly played a part as well. The new series of the different indices will be cleaner both in Europe and in the US, both in investment grade and in high yield.  Their risk premia will be tighter than current series despite the maturity extension, and hedgers could find it difficult to resist the urge to reach for protection.
"
"Eerily Quiet. Even if we had not gone through the action packed period we had since the beginning of the month (or the year actually), today’s session would have seemed dull. The daily ranges were narrow across the board, on indices and on single reference CDS alike, in Europe and in the US. On many names, spreads stayed literally unchanged through the day. The single name and index roll (it all happen at once twice a year from now on, in March and June each year) takes place on Monday, and investors have used the frantic last few sessions to square their portfolios and trim exposures they no longer felt comfortable with. Fallen angels (companies that were downgraded to junk over the last 6 months) will not be included in the new series investment grade indices and the names which the market deem about to default will not be included in the new series of Crossover. Because there were quite a few, that will lead to the unusual situation where, despite being longer dated, the risk premia of series 25 of iTraxx Main and iTraxx Crossover will be tighter than the risk premia of series 24, and the risk premium of series 26 of CDXIG will be tighter than the risk premium of series 25. That could prompt investors to buy protection and trigger some action on Monday. CDXHY will only roll Monday the 28th.
"
"A Session For The Longs. The roll took place today. For the first time, the maturity of the “on-the-run” single name contracts (aka the standard 5 year) were extended by 6 months to the 20th June 2021, rather than the customary 3 months. It looks as if the market was well prepared, and the day felt very orderly. It did not look any different from any previous roll day. New series of indices were issued in Europe, the US and in Asia. The maturities of the on-the-run contracts were extended by 6 months (which was already the standard for indices) and their composition were adjusted to factor in rating and liquidity changes. Big amount of indices were rolled as investors positioned themselves on the newly issued series which will attract most of the liquidity going forward, with several dealers reporting traded volumes in excess of €40bln. It seems that people who are holding long risk positions decided to roll first though, taking comfort from the improved credit quality of all new indices. The selling flow of rolls (people selling protection on the new series to buy protection on the previous series) was relentless and index rolls closed at their most negative levels (-23bps on iTraxx Crossover with S25 closing at 296bps and S24 at 318bps, -1.25bps on iTraxx Main and -7bps on CDXIG) while their fair values were steady during the session.

"
"Calm Prevailed. European credit opened the day on a cautious note, and the tragic events in Belgium initially pushed indices wider as geopolitical risks come back into focus and isolationist movements are expected to gain further momentum. iTraxx Main and iTraxx Crossover touched 75bps and 310bps respectively, but that knee jerk reaction was short lived and they rapidly settled around 73bps and 303bps where they spent the remainder of the session. Volumes were low compared to a very busy session yesterday, but liquidity was never really tested.  As one would expect, the travel sector was under a bit of pressure, but the daily variations were all contained and most of them are arguably within current bid-offer spreads. 
"
"Why Didn’t You Say It?. Since the beginning of the year, the ups and down of PFDLN’s ( Premier Foods Plc ) risk premium have been tightly linked to the moves of iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX). But today the correlation was broken. While ITXEX finished the session 9bps wider at 310bps, PFDLN’s 5 year CDS closed 255bps tighter at 165bps without a buyer of protection in sight. The company announced this morning – and it came as a shock to the market - that they had spurned potential cash offers of 52 pence a share in February and 60 pence a share last week. The offers were made by McCormick & Co, the single A- rated American spice producer, but PFDLN said they would rather join forces with Nissin Foods Holdings Co under some kind of joint venture format that was not described as a merger. The market seems to indicate that the money could be too good to resist to shareholders: the stock closed 70% higher 53.75p.
"
"“Walking Up The Down Escalator”. Recently the British government cut their economic growth forecasts. Today NXT ( Next Plc ) said spending on clothing will not be able to escape the slowing economy. Its CEO likened the year ahead to “walking up the down escalator, with a great deal of effort required to stand still”. He added that 2016 may be the toughest year since the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. Such cautious comments from a company known as one of the industry’s bellwethers added to concern over the outlook for UK retailers, with consumers’ confidence declining in February and the potential Brexit weighting on sentiment. NXT lowered their forecast and now see revenue down 1 to 4% for the year to come, when they expected them to be up 1 to 6% at the very beginning of January. NXT’s 5 year risk premium was duly marked 12.5bps wider at 84.5bps, dragging with it the whole retailing sector (MKS -  Marks and Spencer Group Plc  - was 11.5bps at 135bps for instance).
"
"All Aligned. Investors were back after a 4-day week-end, and it is fair to say that they did not rush to rotate positions on their return. A fair bit of attention still goes into rolling CDS positions at the moment. It was certainly true for CDXHY. Indeed, each new series of CDXHY is issued a week after all other indices and CDXHY26 began trading yesterday. The composition of series 26 is very close of the composition of series 25, and 4 of the 10 additions were actually included in CDXIG series 25. The risk premium of CDXHY26 (at 461.5bps) is quite similar to the risk premium of CDXHY25 (at 453.5bps) and since yesterday, if the CDXHY roll was busy, there did not appear to have any bias so far: long and short risk positions seem to have been moved on the new series in equal measure. It is quite stunning to see that the bases (difference between the quoted value of an index and its theoretical computed using the risk premia of its constituents) of the 4 most recent series of CDXHY are all worth 50bps (give or take a few bps). 
"
"“Considerable Scope”. After almost a week of rather hawkish chatter from some of the regional FED presidents, FED Chair Yellen decided to put things straight during her comments yesterday at the Economic Club of New York. She was back to the cautious script she had adhered to so frequently in the past. The need for “caution” was reiterated many times, and she went as far as to say that the committee has “considerable scope” to ease policy if necessary. US risky assets finished up across the board yesterday night, showing the way to European credit this morning. Despite the move lower in oil, all credit indices were indicated tighter and the direction was never really questioned during the remainder of the session. They outperformed equities but the magnitude of the indices’ move outstripped the move of their fair values, particularly on iTraxx Main (ITXEB) on which large clips of protection were sold throughout the day. So much so that the basis of ITXEB closed at its most negative level in more than 3 years (the risk premium of ITXEB series 25 maturing in 5 years is 72cts cheaper than the theoretical value computed using the risk premia of its constituents). 
"
"Tighter And Compressed. The above grapple shows the two major themes of the week in creditland: risk premia tightened and iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) compressed relative to iTraxx Main (ITXEB). Chair Yellen’s dovish speech echoed in the market and another weekly rally capped an already impressively strong month of March (ITXEX closed at 305bps and ITXEB at 74bps). The compression trend is also the consequence of Central Banks’ action. In the past weeks, because investors thought the ECB corporate bonds buying programme announced on the March 10th would compress investment grade risk premia while high yield risk premia would remain driven by macro data which they expect to be mixed at best, ITXEB had meaningfully outperformed ITXEX. So much so that investors who had played that trend decided to book some profit on (part of) their positions, taking comfort from the basis which is at historically negative levels on ITXEB while it is not really the case on ITXEX.
"
"Unmovable. Oil output less likely to be cut by Saudi Arabia in the face of growing supply from Iran leading to a 3% fall in WTI? Greece, Germany and the IMF arguing over the week-end? Brexit polls still pointing to the greatest uncertainty? The credit market does not really seem to care at the moment and investors’ enquiries are still heavily skewed towards buying risk, particularly on cash products, which inevitably feeds into the CDS markets. If volumes were on the low side and moves generally contained, laggards were very few and far between as depicted by the above grapple. The dominant green shades show that the positive mood was broad based.
"
"Sell When You Can. SHAEFF’s ( Schaeffler AG )founding family announced yesterday that they will sell 94.4m non-voting shares in Schaeffler AG. The sale consists in the disposal of their remaining non-voting stake in the company. It should yield about €1.24Bln that will go towards the reduction of some of the company’s liabilities. They did not give more clarifications as to what debt they will refinance. This sale completes the disposal that was scaled back when VW ( Volkswagen AG ) became embroiled in the emission cheating scandal and created volatility in the market. At the time, only 75m (out of the originally planned 166m) shares were floated in the IPO. The placement was hence not completely unexpected but the timing came as a surprise, in the sense it represents the earliest these remaining shares could have been listed (i.e. 6 months after the initial IPO). It sent the shares down 7%, but it is certainly a positive development for SHAEFF’s credit quality and the 5 year risk premium closed 7bps tighter at 231bps in an otherwise fairly weak market.
"
"Banks Fall Flat. The above grapple depicts the evolution of the difference between the 3 year risk premia and the 5 year risk premia of European investment grade companies as a fonction of their 5 year risk premia over the last year. Almost all the pin heads are pointing right which means that 5 year risk premia have been rising over that period, but the most striking feature is the atypical behaviour of the red population, the financials. While all other sectors see their 3 year 5 year curve increase steadily with the level of the 5 year point, financials tend to flatten much earlier or even decrease. During sell off periods, financials' front end risk premia increase faster as market participants reach agressively for protection. They consider the default of certain entities a distinct possibilty - as evidenced by the recent declaration of the German finance minister warning against a watering down of banks failure rules, including a requirement to impose losses on investors -, but they do not necessarily want to pay premium for a long period of time.

"
"Italian Pain. The above grapple depicts the trajectory of iTraxx Financials Senior Series 24 – it is not the on-the-run series, but series 25 only goes back a couple of weeks -, and it is quite obvious that this sector has not benefitted in away from the ECB bazooka shot. It looks as if QE ultra-low yields are actually holding the banks back, and some analysts are arguing that one of the key downside risk for these institutions is actually persistently low inflation and QE extension. Adding to the sector woes, Italian banks have been under particular scrutiny as the amount of non-performing loans that they are holding in their portfolio recently reached an all-time high and authorities are putting them under increased pressure to improve asset quality. People actually suspect that the ECB could start dictating the pace of problematic loan sales in specific cases. At 14bps, the difference between iTraxx Financials Senior and iTraxx Main, is at the widest it has been on series 24.
"
"ArcelorMittal: Marching Tighter. Despite a weak open in credit land - especially indices -, the session eventually proved resilient for  corporates and the day turned into a slow grind tighter even as stocks had their moments of weakness towards the end of the afternoon. In Europe, the best performing names were found among the high betas, and more specifically in the basic material sector after MTNA ( ArcelorMittal SA ) announced they will buy back bonds after raising $3bln earlier this year in a right issue. They will repurchase €1bln of notes maturing in November 2017, and €500m due in March 2018. They also offered to buy back $1.5bln of securities maturing in June 2018. The levels at which MTNA will buy their bonds are substantially above the levels at which they were trading in the secondary market which left a few people scratching their heads, considering their already tight risk premia. In any case, investors took it positively and they sent the 5 year CDS at its tightest level  (584bps) since the March roll, enabling MTNA to resume its impressive march tighter since the beginning of the year.
"
"Alcoa Blew The Starting Whistle. Yesterday saw the earnings reporting season ‘s starting whistle for Q1 blown by AA ( Alcoa Inc ). They got things started after the closing bell, and the numbers were fairly mixed. While earnings came in above consensus, they missed on revenues. They also lowered their forecast for global demand of aluminium in 2016 – they expect it to climb 5% whereas previously their projection was a 6% increase – and they decreased their market deficit projection – they estimate a 1.1 million metric tons deficit in 2016 versus 1.2 million 3 months ago – as Chinese demand slows. That made AA one of the few names that saw their 5 year risk premium widen (+10bps at 405bps) in an otherwise constructive session. Even if it currently stands far off its February highs of 44%, it means the market assigns a 31% probability to an AA default over during the next 5 years.
"
"Will We See Many?. With the fall of energy prices, the sector has long been highlighted as the most fertile ground for potential defaults.  Some companies already filed for bankruptcy in the recent past in the coal industry (Arch Coal Inc and Alpha Natural Resources) but none were included in the most recent series of CDXHY. Today, BTU (Peabody Energy Corp) joined its rivals and decided to ask for creditor protection. If you look at the above Grapple, which shows that BTU‘s 1 year default probably has been consistently above 80% for the last couple of months, it should not come as a surprise to investors. The name is included in series 24 and 25 of CDXHY in the US, and it will be the first default reported in 2016 in the credit indices universe. VRX (Valeant) received overnight a notice of default from bondholders due to their delayed 10-K-filing. It only triggers if VRX cannot comply by the end of May though, and one of the many distressed US Oil Companies could be the next casualty. In Europe, PORTEL (Portugal Telecom) or NSINO ( Norske Skogindustrier ) could default or restructure their debt sooner rather than later. It looks as if the market should brace itself for more triggered CDS over the next few months.
"
"ESM Back In The Frame?. Over the last few sessions, it has been all about financials. A string of news has contributed to crush banks' risk premia. First the Atlante fund was set up in Italy. The headline equity figure of €5bln is a drop in the ocean compared with the €360bln of bad loan in the Italian financial sector, but it should prove adequate to the most pressing concern: acting as a backstop for ECB-mandated capital raising of the weakest institutions. Then US banks that have reported Q2 earnings so far have surprised on the upside. In itself, it would never have triggered a rally, but at least they did not spoil the party. Then today the idea that the European Stability Mechanism (originally set up to help fund sovereigns) could be used to provide a credit line to troubled banks was floated by Italy and France. That proved too much for investors holding short risk positions on iTraxx Financials Senior (ITXES) and Subordinated (ITXEU) and they aggressively looked for a way out, sending ITXES 6.5bps tighter on the day and 14bps on the week to 87bps and ITXEU 17bps tighter on the day and 41bps on the week to 189bps.
"
"BOMB: Delta To The Rescue. On the day which marked the official start of the UK EU referendum campaigning period, BOMB ( Bombardier, Inc. ) took a stand again Brexit and told workers the company will be better off if “the UK remains within the EU”. That was not the reason for the 120bps tightening of its risk premium though. Late last night, BOMB was said to be near an agreement to sell as many as 75 C series jetliners to Delta Air Lines. The latter would also be seeking options for 50 more of the single-aisle jets to replace some of the older and smaller planes in its fleet. This would be the biggest sale to date for BOMB’s struggling aircraft program, and equal about half the total orders the manufacturer already has in hand. Delta said today that a final decision has not been made – and chances are that even if BOMB gets the order, it will be painful from a price point of view given Airbus, Boeing and Embraer were also in contention -, but investors nevertheless send BOMB’s 5 year risk premium 55bps tighter at 708bps.
"
"Deal Or No Deal. Over the weekend, all eyes were on the long awaited oil producers meeting in Doha. It ended in disappointment, as OPEC members and major producers walked away without any agreement on a production freeze. That initially sent oil 7% lower and markets were weaker across the board. However, as the day progressed, investors holding short risk positions used that blip as an opportunity to reduce their exposure ahead of the performance of Mr Draghi on Thursday. The market was also helped by a strike in Kuwait, which will temporarily limit their oil production by 2/3 and sent the barrel back to unchanged on the day. In the end, despite the worst possible outcome regarding oil output, names that saw their risk premium increase on the day were few and far between. Credit indices and their fair values closed tighter in investment grade and high yield alike, giving the above grapple its greenish colour.
"
"Back With A Vengeance. The failure of the Doha meeting seems a distant memory. For the second day in a row, credit was stronger across the board amid a rise in risky assets and further increase in crude oil prices. Metals were also in better demand with Copper in particular reaching a 3-week-high. Despite some mixed results since the beginning of the reporting season, investors seem to believe we will see increased demand from a growing global economy, which should benefit from a stabilisation in China. The recession talks from February appear to be over, and all of a sudden, companies that everybody loved to hate are back with a vengeance. Over the last couple of sessions, people have been scrambling to exit short risk positions in the basic material and energy sectors, making them outperform the rest of the market by a mile. To name a few, the risk premium of FCX (Freeport McMoran) was 190bps tighter today (and 489bps tighter in a week), RIG’s (Transocean) was 387bps tighter (408bps in a week) and TCKBCN’s (Teck Resources Ltd) was 287bps tighter (and 560bps tighter in a week)
"
"Will They Or Won’t They?. Activity was understandably timid ahead of tomorrow’s ECB meeting and the market had to feed on crumbs in terms of news. The tone was generally positive though, and the appetite for buying protection felt limited to say the least. VUECIN (Vougeot) was among the odd-one-outs though. On Monday, the cinema chain was rumoured to be working on a LSE listing in 2017. Press articles went as far as mentioning PwC as advisors on the float and a GBP1.7bln valuation was put forward, and VUE’s 5 year CDS was marked 38bps tighter on that day. This morning, while they reported Q1 2016 fiscal results which were encouraging with increases in average ticket price, retail spent per person and screen advertising, the company also mentioned during their call that they are not currently contemplating an IPO. Investors used this as an excuse to consolidate part of the 80bps tightening that we have seen over the last week and a half and sent VUE’s 5 year risk premium 20bps wider at 324bps.
"
"The Race To Zero. It was a pretty quiet lead up to the ECB meeting, but for the second time in a row, Mr Draghi managed to surprise everybody. The details of the ECB Corporate Sector Purchase Program (CSPP), which were described today, were more aggressive than most market participants expected. The bond-buying program will include insurers and target bonds with a maturity up to 30 years. iTraxx Financials Senior and Subordinated consequently outperformed the rest of the credit market, which outperformed other asset classes (stocks were hardly changed on the day). The market reaction was about what was new, but it is also about positioning. Currently, the credit space in Europe seems to be underinvested on the margin, and whilst nobody is really excited about valuations, when nobody is long enough, the path of least resistance is tighter.
"
"The Week That Was. The firm tone continued today, even though volumes were light compared with the trading frenzy that followed the ECB meeting yesterday. Credit indices traded sideways and the single names that enjoyed the most astonishing performance since the beginning of the week (namely these belonging to the basic material and energy sectors) consolidated part of their recent gains. The financial sector kept its momentum though, and with inclusion of insurance companies in the ECB’s bond buying program, it seems to be the main beneficiary of the measures announced on Thursday. It is therefore not surprising to find the darkest shades of green in the upper left corner of the above grapple.
"
"Ardagh (ARGID) Delivers A Supply Boost to HY Markets. In February 2015, Ball agreed to acquire Rexam in a deal that would combine two of the world’s largest makers of cans for drinks, and it has been trying since to win regulatory approval for the deal. Today, it announced that it had agreed with Rexam to sell plants in Brazil and Europe together with innovation and support functions in Brazil, Britain, Germany, Switzerland and the United States to ARGID (Ardagh Packaging) to satisfy some of these regulatory concerns. This divestment program itself is subject to regulatory approvals, but it should enable ARGID to acquire assets with combined revenues of around $3bln and will cost the company approximately $3.4bln. To help finance the operation, ARGID will issue $2.85bln of secured and unsecured notes in the coming weeks. They had been rumoured to be the leading bidders for Ball-Rexam assets for a while, and that is the reason why the risk premium of ARGID never really participated in the rally that took iTraxx Crossover from 336bps on the April 8th to 294bps last Friday. Nevertheless, the quasi-certain perspective of more leverage led investors to mark ARGID’s 5 year CDS 36bps wider (to 452bps) today.
"
"NXP: Car Driven Results. NXP ( NXP Semiconductors NV ) is a leading chip supplier for smartphones, but it is also a major supplier of chips for the auto industry following its recent acquisition of FSL (Freescale Semiconductor). These chips have a wide range of applications, from advanced driver assistance systems to “infotainment” or in-vehicle networking between different car systems. NXP’s strength in the auto industry is one of the reasons the company managed to surprise investors when it reported Q1 2016 numbers this morning, which were in line with analysts’ expectations. More importantly, even though management said the overall demand continues to be subdued, they also said that headwinds experienced last year should begin to subside in the coming quarter. This cautious optimism enabled them to present a Q2 outlook that came a touch ahead of consensus (revenues of $2.3-2.4bln vs a consensus of $2.3bln; gross margin at 49.5-50.5% vs a consensus of 49.8%). In an otherwise directionless session, NXP was rewarded with a 14bps tightening of its 5 year risk premium at 179bps.
"
"Farewell Norske Skogindustrier. It is difficult to get rid of bad habits, and it seems that NSINO’s ( Norske Skogindustrier ) management cannot help to kick the can down the road when it comes to addressing their debt pile problem. They have been on the verge of default for a while, but somehow they have so far managed to avoid it. Their most recent manoeuvre involved extending the maturity of some of their shorter dated bonds. The ISDA Determination Committee decided on Friday, 22nd April that it amounted to a restructuring credit event and investors who have bought protection on NSINO will have the opportunity (but they do not have to ) to trigger their CDS contracts until the auction is held. In any case, it means that on Monday NSINO has been spun off from all the credit indices to which it belonged. An investor X who had on Friday a €74m position on iTraxx Crossover Series 23 (ITXEX23) for instance has now a position of €73m ITXEX23 that does not include NSINO any longer and a separate €1m position on NSINO. Investor X still has to deal with his NSINO CDS position, but investor Y who buys or sells ITXEX23 today does not have to worry about the fate of NSINO. Since Monday morning, Series 23 and older are much cleaner portfolios – Series 24 and 25 never included NSINO – which explains their outperformance on a weekly basis.
"
"Japan Credit Unmoved. The Japan credit market was unmoved by the Bank of Japan holding off adding stimulus. The cluster of Japan CDS traded just 1bp wider on average. The Japan CDS Cluster is still and by far the tightest of our Machine Tree with an average spread of 68bps. At 70bps, the iTraxx Japan Series 25 is the tightest of the tradable investment grade credit default swap indices. Apart from Japan, the European banking sector was the most interesting today with DB CDS 5bps tighter post earning while Banco Novo CDS was much larger after the Administrative Lisbon Court provisionally decreed an injunction about one of the bond series transfer from Banco Novo to BES. In the US, oil CDS sector keeps tightening and the sector will be an outstanding performer in April 2016. 
"
"The Phoenix from Ohio. AK Steel Holding Corporation is issuing 52M shares, 25% of its market capitalization, to repay its outstanding borrowing under its asset-based revolver facility.  While its 2020 bond was trading at 35 cents on the dollar in January, it is now trading close to 90 cents. With iron ore up more than 50% this year, with Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton critical of China’s trade practices, equity investors are viewing the AK Steel stock as a call on the US steel recovery. The credit was quick to catch up and the move has been impressive. According to the Grapple, the market default probability within 5 years was close to be certain 4 months ago at 90%. The market is tonight “only” pricing a 45% probability of default over the next 5 years. United States Steel Corporation had the same trajectory this year, from 90% to 40%.  Distress credits can offer a lot of convexity to investors, and positive convexity for once.
"
"Sell In May…. UK investors were back from a 3-day weekend and some investors in continental Europe have a 4-day weekend in sight, it was therefore not surprising that liquidity was thin. It definitely amplified the magnitude of the moves today and exacerbated the weakness felt across the board. Financials were under particular pressure (irrespective of the quality of their results for these that reported this morning) and were the laggards - with the basic materials sector - among European credits. Among them, peripherals banks suffered the most. The move was driven by the failure of the listing of Popolare di Vicenza on the Milan stock exchange. The IPO attracted too little interest and because the resulting free float would have been very small, the bank did not get the green light to proceed. As a result, the Atlante fund, which had underwritten the capital increase, will own a 99.3% stake in Vincenza. That is roughly €1.5bln that will not be available to the fund to buy non-performing loans.
"
"Trouble In Store For UK Retailers?. This morning two of UK’s leading retailers released their numbers, highlighting that whether you are selling clothes or food it is a tough business to be in at the moment.  NXT ( Next Plc ) said it had been a tough start of the year and the company cut its sales outlook for the second time in six weeks, as “the weakness in the quarter maybe indicative of weaker underlying demand for clothing and a potentially wider slowdown in consumer spending”. SBRY ( J Sainsbury Plc ) reported a mixed set of results and said it sees no let-up in the competition and deflation that have characterised the supermarket industry in recent years. With both companies’ disappointing numbers and cautious outlooks, it was not surprising to see the UK retailers underperform other companies in the broader ""Food and Retail"" cluster identified by DataGrapple.
"
"Shoud I Stay Or Should I Go Now?. As you can see with the pale shades of the above grapple, it was a fairly dull day with most of Continental Europe out. A few names are flashing red though, and most of them are in the top right corner where the Energy and Basic Materials sectors can be found. Indeed, WFT ( Weatherford International Plc ) reported a larger than expected first quarter loss and lowered their free cash flow guidance for the year. That comes at a time where most people holding short risk positions have capitulated and sold the protection they owned during the aggressive rally we have seen since the February wides. As a results, there are very few investors left willing to offer CDS, and whenever buyers show up, risk premia are marked wider very rapidly. This technical factors go a long way towards explaining why WFT’s 5 year CDS was marked 7pts wider today. They also explains investors’ unease with the tight risk premia across the energy sector at the moment. If you extend the time span to a week (click on the ""1W"" toggle above the grapple) in the above grapple, you will see a number of names flashing red in that top right corner. WFT was not the first company to give up some of its recent impressive gains.
"
"Wider We Go... For Now. Thin liquidity is not helping current market confusion. On the one hand, credit has been drifting wider all week long. In the US, outflows in the biggest High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (the iShares HYG Index) are getting out of control. They amounted to more than $3bln over the last 5 days, or 17% of total AUM! US data continue to disappoint with labour market showing signs of weakness. Therefore flows are dominated by investors taking chips off the table. On the other hand, the labour market is a key indicator of FED’s forward guidance and, after today’s disappointing NonFarm Payrolls number, it is now likely that rates will remain on hold in the US at least until September – the probability of a hike in June implied by the price of future contracts stands at 2% -. That could contribute to put the market right back in its assisted comfort zone. We will see next week whether the recent trend wider is confirmed with the expected pick up in flows.
"
"Should They Go Hand In Hand?. Disappointing data in China is never good news for commodities. Industrial metals fell as a slump in Chinese copper purchases and an increase in steel metal exports signalled weak demand in the top user. That led to a sharp increase of the risk premia in the mining and basic materials sectors. But with risk premia still compressed compared with the wides of the year, some analysts now argue that it would make sense to distinguish between miners and still producers. They argue that miners have been proactive in cutting their balance sheet down with some robust asset disposal plans now under way. Most recently AALLN (Anglo American Plc) announced the sale of its Nionbium and phosphates division, while GLEINT ( Glencore Plc ) is looking to sell a further stake in its agri unit. On their side, steel producers like MTNA ( ArcelorMittal SA ) or TKAGR ( ThyssenKrupp AG ) do not have such levers to easily pull and have high operational leverage to steel prices. Should we have another round of weakness in commodity prices, the balance sheet of miners could begin to look healthier than that of steel producers.
"
"Debt Relief On The Agenda?. OTE ( Hellenic Telecommunications Organisation SA ), which is 40% owned and managed by Germany’s DT (Deutsche Telekom AG) reported first quarter numbers last Wednesday. It is fair to say that the 16% drop in net profit failed to trigger any excitement and the market reaction was fairly muted. What really got investors going is the positive tone at the Eurogroup meeting. Debt relief options are being discussed earlier than investors expected - even though the first bailout review has still not been concluded and is still a precondition -, and hopes are high that a conclusion could be reached in May. The positive tone in the Greek Government Bonds was enough to send OTE’s 5 year risk premium 35bps tighter at 431bps.
"
"An Opportunity To Short?. Shares in SPLS (Staples Inc) and ODP (Office Depot Inc) plummeted the most ever after a federal judge blocked the combination of the 2 largest office suppliers, saying it would create an unrivalled giant. The companies said they would not appeal. That is not as bad a piece of news for SPLSs debt holders though, as the leverage will remain around 3.2 times. It will not go up to 4.5 times as would have been in the case had the merger gone through. Fitch were quick to react and removed the Rating watch negative following the announcement, and affirmed SPLS at BB+ with a stable outlook. Accordingly, the 5 year risk premium traded 23bps tighter at 252bps in light flows. Some argue that it could actually be a good opportunity to short the name, given that a 3.2 times leverage remains high and that SPLS as a standalone business has been one of the worst performing in retail with the office supply segment in secular decline and negative sales and margin trends for years.
"
"Closer To The Edge. The 5 year risk premium of PORTEL (Portugal Telecom) was marked aggressively wider during the afternoon session. It traded at 77 points (to insure $1 worth of debt over 5 years, one has to pay 77cts upfront plus 1.25cts on a quarterly basis), up 3.75 points compared with yesterday. That was not triggered by Brazil’s senate’s vote to suspend Dilma Rousseff from office, after months of political turmoil in the recession-wracked country. Than was not triggered by the wider-than-expected loss which Oi SA, PORTEL’s parent company, reported for the first quarter of 2016. That followed the news that, because the company has paid back some loans at par, there is now less cash available. Their cash balance stood at BRL8.5bln (roughly $2.5bln) compared with approximately BRL15bln at the end of December. Get ready for a credit event anytime soon.
"
"US Retailers’ Funk. The above grapple depicts the weekly change of the risk premia of the constituents of the US Corporate cluster identified by DataGrapple. Retailers are easy to spot. In an otherwise resilient market as shown by the greenish shades of most boxes, all of them are red (and some bright red). Most of them reported first quarter numbers, and all of them managed to disappoint. Today, JCP (J C Penney Company, Inc) posted revenues that trailed analysts’ estimates and joined fellow discount-oriented KSS (Kohl’s Corporation) which missed estimates yesterday. Higher end rivals did not fare any better. M (Macy’s, Inc) reported lacklustre results and lowered EPS guidance for the year by 57cts (to $3.15-$3.40 from $3.80-$3.90), while JWN (Nordstrom, Inc) also added to evidence that the department store industry is mired in a deep slump when it cut its annual earning forecast. Shoppers across the income spectrum appear to pull back on purchases of apparel and other discretionary goods.
"
"Weak and Slow, But Mainly Slow. As expected today’s session was very quiet with most of Europe out. Volumes were light but the tone was cautious across the board and while US indices were unchanged at the European close, every member of the iTraxx family (Main, Financial Senior and Subordinated, and Crossover) saw their risk premia increase. Their fair values were also wider. The weakness was led by UK retailers – MKS ( Marks and Spencer Group Plc  ) +3bps @ 151bps, NTX ( Next Plc )  +2.5bps @ 110, MRWLN (Wm. Morrisson Supermarkets Plc) +8.5bps @ 132bps -, as Brexit weights on investors’ mind, and EDF (+7.5bps @ 95bps) which got downgraded by S&P; by 2 notches to BBB. The company was removed from credit watch, but the outlook is still negative and another notch will be cut if EDF goes ahead with Hinkley Point.
"
"Mega Deals. Credit indices failed to offer any meaningful changes on the day and daily variations were minimal across the board (iTraxx Main unchanged @ 78bps, iTraxx Crossover 1bp tighter @ 327bps, CDX IG unchanged at 81.5bps), even if there was some intraday volatility. A positive open in Europe following the continued commodity recovery and buoyed equity markets was cancelled in the afternoon by better than expected economic statistics in the US which raised the prospect of a June interest rate FED hike. The real excitement actually came from the cash market. Numerous new deals have been issued since the beginning of the month on both sides of the Atlantic. Yesterday saw the launch of a multitranch deal by Dell. The mega deal will amount to $20bln split over 6 maturities ranging from 3 to 30 years. It allegedly attracted more than $80bln in orders and all tranches were indicated tighter than their issue price in the grey market. Such an enthusiasm eventually impacted the 5 year CDS which closed 18bps tighter at 520bps, which is the tightest it has traded since the March roll.  
"
"Headline Bingo?. It was an uneventful credit option expiry day. Once again daily changes were minimal, and today even intraday ranges were tight (1bp on iTraxx Main and CDXIG, and 4bps on iTraxx Crossover). Most of investors’ attention is still going to cash, but everyone expects Brexit concern to take center stage over the next few weeks. Headlines will attract more attention, not only ones announcing discounted seats on Ryanair’s flights so that UK citizens can fly home the 22nd and 23rd June and allow them vote “Remain”! Today, a poll by Ipsos Mori shown “Remain” leading by 55% to 37% in a substantial move from other recent similar polls showing the in and out campaigns running neck and neck. Apart from triggering sharp moves of the Pound (+0.80% against the USD and +1.60% against the Euro), it also sent the 5 year CDS of most UK banks tighter, making them the outperformers of the day. 
"
"Monetary Divergence. The ECB minutes were on the dovish side, with a clear reminder that CSPP will start in June, and one we assume earlier rather than later to avoid starting the purchase program in summer liquidity. On the other hand, FED hawks made sure the market understands that June is a live meeting. There is definitely a sense of weakness (backed by the increased probability of a rate hike in June going up to 32% compared with 4% early Monday), but the credit market is struggling to move wider on either side of the Atlantic. The spread between the risk premia of iTraxx Main in Europe and CDX IG in the US has been relatively stable since mid-April. But given the monetary divergence, some will certainly feel that owning CDS on US names is more comfortable than owning protection on their European equivalents.
"
"Financials: Time To Trim Shorts?. Even if you factor in the roll that took place in March (iTraxx Financial Senior S25 – ITXES25 - is 6bps wider than S24 while iTraxx Main S25 – ITXEB25 - is trading flat to S24), the above grapple shows that financials have massively underperformed the rest of the market since the beginning of the year. In fact, financials are trading at multi-year wides compared with other corporates. Among the ten widest names in iTraxx Main Series 25 (which includes 125 constituents of which 30 belong to the financial sector), seven are banks. While corporates’ risk premia have been dragged tighter by the ECB buying program, financials’ have suffered from the low interest rate environment which is harming profitability, worries around non-performing loans particularly in the periphery and Brexit fears. So much so that some investors decided to book profits on short risk positions on financials over the last couple of days. With buyers of protection on the sector now few and far between, ITXES525 closed almost 5bps tighter at 97bps today and outperformed ITXEB25 (which closed at 78bps) by 2.5bps, while iTraxx Financials Subordinated, which suffers from patchy liquidity, closed 14bps tighter at 210bps.
"
"Too Much And Not Enough?. If you thought last week was slow, then what should be said about today? Volumes reported to DTCC were less than €2.5bln for iTraxx Main and hardly more than €500mln for iTraxx Crossover. So BAYNGR (Bayer AG) provided a welcome patch of activity after it announced its offer to acquire Monsanto for $122/share (or an enterprise value of $62bln) in an all cash transaction. BAYNGR intends to finance the operation with a combination of debt and equity. The equity portion should amount to $15.5bln and the company said they will use primarily senior debt to fund the transaction. They expect an investment grade rating immediately after the closing of the transaction, and target single A status in the long term if they were to be downgraded (S&P; said they could lower BAYNGR’s rating by 2 notches to BBB depending on the final terms). While equity investors seem to think the price may not be enough to tempt Mosanto’s shareholders (the stock of the latter traded at $107, well short of the offer level, implying a fair degree of scepticism), credit investors seem to think the price is quite full and they sent BAYNGR’s 5 year risk premium 9bps wider at 67bps.
"
"Action At Last!. Since the beginning of May, iTraxx Main (ITXEB) had been stuck in a 76-80bps range. After a strong session with the rally in stocks obviously the catalyst for some hedges to come off, credit indices finally closed through their May tights. As is usually the case during aggressive moves, indices reacted faster than their constituents, which saw their risk prima tightened only half as fast. That sent index bases to the lower end of their recent range, and made people take that move with a pinch of salt. With some action packed weeks ahead of us (Payrolls statistics in the US, details of the CSPP during the ECB meeting, Spanish elections and UK referendum), investors will want to see some follow-up among single name CDS to consider it is not just a flash in the pan that deserves to be faded.
"
"Shouldn’t The Tide Lift All Boats?. MKS ( Marks and Spencer Group Plc ) reported full its full year results for 2015/2016 this morning. They managed to beat expectations as EBITDA was up 3.7% to £1.36bln driven by improvements in both Clothing & Home and Food profitability. Net debt is down £85mln, which leaves leverage at 1.6x from 1.9x a year earlier. Despite these positive developments, and despite an incredibly supportive environment (even if it is the second day in a row that iTraxx Main’s risk premium tightens by more than 3bps, it does not happen that often), MKS’s 5 year CDS closed 2.5bps wider at 146.5bps. The company announced it will reduce styles to de-clutter stores and reduce its promotional stance which raised concerns over short term profits. More disappointingly, the strategy laid out by the management did not address key decisions, and the review of its international business and UK store estate will be conducted in the autumn. That said, MKS’s stock plunged 10% despite the return of a special 4.9p dividend (equivalent to £75mln), so maybe credit investors should consider themselves lucky.

"
"Sitting On The Edge. Credit markets have let the rally monkey out since the beginning of the week. Oil is closing on $50/barrel. A deal on Greece was conjured out of nowhere. And there is growing confidence that the US economy can weather another rate hike (after having priced the possibility that the US could enter into recession less than three months ago…). It is no wonder that a slight consolidation occurred today, but it was no more than that. All credit indices saw their risk premia closed tighter on the day, and iTraxx Main (ITXEB) and iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) came close to support levels without breaking them though. Some investors are taking chips off the table, others are entering cautiously defensive strategies (like covered receivers where people buy protection and sell to someone the option to buy it back from them at wider levels), but no one is aggressively buying protection yet. If ITXEB and ITXEX break through 70bps and 300bps, it could be like trying to catch a falling knife.
"
"Calm Before The Storm?. As expected, today was a very quiet session ahead of the bank holiday week-end - which means US and UK financial centres will be closed for 3 days - and Mrs Yellen speaking this evening. The latter speech and next week ECB meeting are potential market movers. They could push credit one way or the other, and investors have been cautious enough to square their positions before today’s liquidity lull. Changes on the day were minimal on a vast majority of names, as shown be the pale shade of the above grapple. There are a few bright spots of red courtesy of US energy names, which gave up part of the impressive gains they made yesterday. PIZEXP (Pizzaexpress) was also among the underperformers . Their partnership with O2 and a new home delivery strategy were not enough to compensate for disappointing 2016 Q3 numbers.
"
"A Brexit Foretaste?. Today was a fairly slow session, that should be split in 2 halves though. Until mid-afternoon, credit indices felt bid for choice, but while there were definitely people willing to buy protection, none was really willing to pay-up. iTraxx Main (ITXEB) remained wrapped around 71.5bps and iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX)was wrapped around 308bps. Then the results of a two UK referendum polls were released. Both shown the “leave” camp regaining the lead over the “stay” camp (one conducted on the phone predicted a 45%-42% results, and another conducted online predicted a 47%-44%). That triggered a knee jerk reaction from ITXEB, which went a couple of basis points wider to finish the session at 73bps (2.5bps wider on the day) and was the clear underperformer of the day (CDX IG in the US was only 0.5bps wider at 76.75bps). It gave us some insight into how credit indices will trade over the forthcoming weeks on this type of noise. If the “leave” camp looks like it is going to win as it did today, then ITXEX will underperform CDXIG, ITXES (iTraxx Financial Senior) will underperform ITXEB, and ITXEX will be the most resilient index.
"
"Is It Boldness Or Caution?. Today was mainly a continuation of yesterday’s session, as a couple of hours were not enough for the market to digest the perceived increase of Brexit probability. Credit indices closed off their widest levels, but they all ended the day weaker and the bid for protection felt relatively deep as flows somewhat picked up compared with yesterday. It is a bold call to go short risk in Europe right into the face of the CSPP (the ECB should give details of the programme on Thursday), but it could actually just be caution. DTCC published their weekly statistics regarding client positioning as of last Friday. They showed that buy side institutions had increased long risk positions on iTraxx Main by $1.4bln, on iTraxx Crossover by $0.6bln. They also cut their short risk positions in iTraxx Financials Senior $1.0bln. Rather than doubting Mr Draghi, maybe people are just trimming consensual CSPP long risk positions after all.
"
"What 5 Year CDS Tells You About 1 Year CDS?. WFT ( Weatherford International Plc ) was one of the star performer today, and it had nothing to do with the rebound of oil towards $50/barrel from an intraday low yesterday of $47.8. The company announced today the pricing of an upsized underwritten offering of $1.1bln exchangeable notes due 2021. The proceeds will be used to fund tender offers for front-end bonds, notably the ones maturing in 2017 and 2017. Not only did that send the 5 year risk premium almost 4pts tighter at 28.75pts (plus 100bps running), but the risk premium curve steepened meaning fully. So much so that we are now it the weird situation where the 1 year risk premium of WFT is trading at 88bps which is roughly the same level as the 1 year risk premium of APC (Anadarko Petroleum Corporation), CNQCN (Canadian Natural Resource Ltd) or ENB (Enbridge Inc), while WFT’s 5 year risk premium is worth 938bps and those of APC, CNQCN or ENB are worth 267bps, 268bps and 290bps respectively. Some say it is a relative value opportunity, others it is just rational thinking.
"
"Nothing Seems Too Big. AET ( Aetna Inc ) and Humana are working through Department of Justice and state regulatory review of their pending merger, and pushbacks in states where they both have a major presence is to be expected. That is effectively what happened recently in Missouri where they were told they would be barred from selling some products. Nevertheless, it did not deter AET from issuing $13bln of bonds yesterday to help finance the $37bln operation. After 2 days of investor calls, they brought an 8-tranch-deal spanning from 18 months to 30 years. That probably explains why AET’s 5 year risk premium moved wider over the last few days. After the demand for the deal reached $43bln and all tranches were tightened by 10 to 30bps across the curve, the widening stopped though. The market still continues to digest record levels of issuance… for now.
"
"Brexit vs CSPP. It was difficult today to reconcile the moves in credit with the moves in other risky assets, particularly with equities. While the latter remained in a relatively tight range, credit indices – and more specifically iTraxx Main (ITXEB) – experienced large swings. The session began on a weak note after more Brexit polls shown the “leave” camp still in the lead over the week-end, and ITXEB traded as wide as 77.5bps. That move did not last long though. With the start of the CSPP due in a couple of days, investors decided to fade the widening and begun selling protection on ITXEB. That trend progressively gained traction and ITXEB finished at 73bps, only a couple of bps away from its recent tights. Brexit fears did not leave the market unscathed though. While all credit indices saw their risk premia closed tighter on the day, iTraxx Financials underperformed as UK banks failed to participate in the rally. Among the 24 corporates included in ITXEB which closed wider, 11 are UK based companies.
"
"Janet Is More Than A Match For Mario… Or Is It Boris?. Over the last couple of months, much has been said regarding the CSPP which will begin effectively tomorrow and the effect that it could have (or already had) on risk premia in Europe. Effectively, despite the best effort of the “leave” camp in the UK to introduce growing uncertainty regarding the final outcome of the Brexit referendum, risk premia in Europe have been very well behaved. The best example is iTraxx Main Series 25 (ITXEB25), which has stayed within a 10bps range since the 10th April, and is currently trading close to the tighter end. But what is striking in the above grapple is that CDX IG Series 26, its US counterpart, which traded 6bps wider than ITXEB25 only a few sessions ago, has now closed the gap that separated the two credit indices. FED Chair Yellen has been successful in her balancing act so far. After saying 10 days ago at Harvard University that a rate hike might be appropriate in the coming months, she carefully avoided any mention of timing yesterday, insisting instead that any further rate increase will be gradual, as well as trying not to read too much into the poor set of employment data which spooked the market on Friday.
"
"Another Change In Wind Direction. Today was the day where CSPP kicked off. That initially gave a positive tone to the credit market which lasted until mid-afternoon when the euro began to strengthen. That sent credit indices into reverse and they finally closed unchanged across the board. One name which participated in the early rally never looked back though. WINDIM (Wind) saw its 5 year risk premium tighten dramatically from 498bps to 453bps for reasons that have nothing to with the ECB buying bonds. This was all due to a story that came out late last night that suggested parties could be interested in buying redundant wireless frequencies and towers to create a 4th operator in Italy. This would go a long way toward alleviating concerns of the regulator. By lining up buyers, Hutchison’s 3 Italia and Vimpelcom’s Wind are trying to avoid a repeat of last month, when the EU vetoed the merger between O2 and 3 in the UK. As investors are getting more bullish about a deal getting through, WIND’s 5 year CDS’s is changing path yet another time. 
"
"Another Day, Another Potential Deal In The Telco Sector. The CEO of PFOURS (P4) has been saying for some time that an IPO could be a possibility, but that the Polish operator would wait for markets to improve before pulling the trigger. It seems that stars could be aligning. The company’s owners are rumoured to have selected UBS and Bank of America as advisers for the potential sale of the Polish operator of Play mobile network. A number of private equity funds may be interested in the purchase, but industry players like Telenor, TeliaSonera, Telekom Austria as well as Liberty Global may also consider acquisition. Alternatively, PFOURS’s owners may seek the sale of a 50% stake in the company via an IPO allowing them to pay a dividend. That was taken positively by the market which sent PFOURS’s 5 year risk premium 19bps tighter at 170bps.
"
"Everybody To The Left... And Everybody To The Right. It has been coming for a few days. Since the beginning of the week, the risk premia of individual companies had been supported by the imminency of the CSPP and then its official launch. The ECB made a bold statement as they apparently begun by buying bonds at the lower end of the allowed rating spectrum. At the same time, Brexit came back into focus, as a victory of the “leave” now seems a distinct possibility in the UK referendum. That certainly put pressure on credit indices. But today everything succumbed to the weak macro risk sentiment. Credit indices and their theoretical values alike took a leg wider (following equities with Eurostoxx down 2.8% the day) which brought most risk premia to the wider end of their recent range, while they were at the tight end hardly more than a week ago. S&P; wobble… ECB credibility challenge… FED hawk speak… and we can easily imagine ourselves in a world of pain.
"
"Brexit Complacency No More. The market was weak from the word “go” this morning, and iTraxx Main (ITXEB) reached 81bps after a couple of hours of trading, dragged wider by the financial sector which suffered from more polls indicating that the “leave” camp may come on top in the UK referendum regarding their EU membership. A turnaround appeared to be in the cards as there was not any follow through on protection buying when the US came in and ITXEB went back to 80bps. But during the last part of the session, renewed weakness among UK banks sent ITXEB to new recent wides at 82.25bps where it eventually closed. It seems that investors are reassessing what the possible impact of the 23rd June vote could be. A “stay” scenario was always expected to send ITXEB back to 65bps and that has not changed. But many now think that a “leave” scenario could see ITXEB trades towards 100bps when 85bps was considered the upper bound previously. 
"
"Should We Blame Options?. Despite a benign close in the US overnight, European credit looked like it could get out of control early in the morning. iTraxx Main (ITXEB) rapidly went traded as wide as 88bps (almost 6bps wider on the day!) and iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) as wide as 373bps (22bps wider at that stage). More Brexit fears were to blame, but they were only the sparks that triggered a move which was effectively fuelled by negative gamma positions. One of the busiest option expiry of the year takes place tomorrow. In such circumstances, people who sold options have some heavy rebalancing to do when the market is going through the exercise price of the options they sold. Specifically, this morning, they had to buy protection when the credit market was going wider, as the 85bps level was breached on ITXEB and ITXEX approached 375bps.
"
"Almost In The Green. After a few torrid sessions, there was a bounce back in risky assets across the board and they staged a mini rally into the FOMC tonight. For most of the day, that benefitted credit as well. Credit indices stayed in a tight range and were hovering around the tights. But while profit takers had been consistently selling protection on single reference entities throughout the day - especially on UK banks -, buyers of protection on iTraxx Financial Senior emerged out of nowhere towards the close and pushed the whole iTraxx complex to new wides in Europe, denying almost all European credit indices a first positive close. That led to another day of underperformance of iTraxx Main (ITXEB) compared with CDX IG, its US equivalent. ITXEB now trades 3bps wider than CDX IG, when it was 6bps tighter 3 weeks ago.
"
"Get Used To It!. If you look at the daily variations, you will probably wonder what the fuss was all about in creditland. But if we had closed 2 hours earlier, the picture would have been totally different. The session had been completely one sided thus far, and investors were relentlessly buying protection on iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX), iTraxx Main (ITXEB) and iTraxx Financials Senior (ITXES). Protection buying on single names was more discriminating, particularly in the financial sector. Peripheral names appeared to be under particular pressure, together with the UK institutions. So it seems that investors are beginning to price in the possible second round effect of Brexit and possible contagion risks. All the protection buying came to halt a couple of hours before the close though, and risk premia went very rapidly to unchanged levels on the day. It means that the total variation of ITXEB on the day was almost 10bps (88-92-86.5) and the total variation of ITXEX was 35bps (374-394-379). At least until the end of the month, you have better get used to intraday volatility. It is not going anywhere any time soon.
"
"Done And Dusted?. Given today’s price, you would be forgiven for thinking that the EU referendum was done and dusted. iTraxx Main (ITXEB) opened 5bps tighter this morning compared with Friday’s close, as the British Pound staged an impressive rebound against the US Dollar overnight, trading up four handles from 1.43 to 1.47. Risk premia continued to drift tighter during the session and ITXEB closed 7bps tighter at 78.5bps. Recent underperformers were today’s best performing assets. ITXEB is now 1.5bps than CDX IG in the US (from 3bps wider on Friday) and 5 year CDS in the financial sector moved indiscriminately tighter. It is difficult to say whether the magnitude of today’s move was more indicative of the amount of short risk positions that had been amassed, or of the lack of liquidity. In fact, at current levels, credit has probably regained a bit more symmetry whether we Bremain or Brexit.
"
"They Left It Late. Oi eventually filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday in Brazil after it failed to reach a deal with its creditors over $19Bln in debts. The petition in a Rio de Janeiro Court from the fourth biggest mobile provider and six subsidiaries (including PORTEL – Portugal Telecom International Finance BV – which is the entity referenced by CDS) came after its chief executive quit 10 days ago and talks with creditors ground to a halt ahead of a 231MEuros payment for a euro denominated bond in about a month. As shown by the above grapple, a credit event on PORTEL has never really been in doubt given the very distressed level of the 5 year risk premium over the last quarter, but the timing will make for interesting discussions at the ISDA Decision Committee, which ultimately rules on which contracts effectively protect against the default. A number of CDS (and many indices among them as PORTEL was a popular name in old series of iTraxx Main and iTraxx Crossover) were maturing on the 20th June 2016, the very same day Oi decided to file.
"
"All Square Now?. DTCC published their weekly statistics this morning, and they go a long way in explaining the rough patch risk premia went through. They show that on all index families, clients have been buying protection. On iTraxx Main they reduced their long risk position by roughly $5bln given the rising political uncertainties in Europe. That still left them with a healthy $20bln long risk position though. On iTraxx Financials Senior (ITXES), they increased their short risk positions by more than $1.5bln. As of last Friday, it was standing at levels close to what they were holding at the height of the Greek crisis last summer. In CDX IG, Buy Side institutions trimmed their long risk positions by $7.5Bln, but that remains close to their largest positions over the last 4 years. Important moves took place on Monday, which means that people have kept adjusting their positions, but yesterday and today daily variations were minimal, barring a 5bps move on ITXES. It looks as if they are pretty much where they want to be in terms of market exposure, and they are now bracing themselves for the aggressive moves that will no doubt take place on Friday morning.
"
"All Bets Are Off. No one will be surprised to hear that today was a rather illiquid session. Investors had plenty of time since the beginning of week to adjust their portfolio and none of them really wanted to wait for the last minute to square positions. Nevertheless, it was a positive session for risk across the board. After a 2-day pause, credit indices resumed their march tighter and single name risk premia followed suit. All risky assets, from foreign exchange to equities, including interest rate and credit, do not give any chance of Brexit to come on top. If Bremain prevails, it is likely that moves will be contained as risk has come a long way since the mid of last week (iTraxx Main and iTraxx Crossover are respectively 16bps and 70bps off their 92bps and 394bps recent widest levels). If Brexit wins, then tomorrow will be a nasty session and people who were cautious enough to buy downside protection through options (even with far out of the money strikes, as expectations are for iTraxx Main to open north of 100bps in the event of “leave” prevailing) will be massively rewarded. 
"
"So Now We Know. Or Do We?. The outcome of the UK referendum took markets by surprise, and the decision to leave the EU was nowhere near priced in the creditland yesterday. The open, which took place a few hours earlier than usual, reflected that shock. iTraxx Main (ITXEB), iTraxx Financials Senior (ITXES) and iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) were quoted respectively 28bps (at 105bps), 55bps (at 150bps) and 77bps (at 435bps) wider. Some impressive volumes went through and several dealers reported trading activity in excess of $10bln on indices only. This activity brought indices substantially off their widest levels, and they roughly closed on last Thursday’s wides. The action we have seen last week definitely helped to clear some risk and allowed for what could be described as an “orderly sell-off” today. But one can only think that this is only the beginning, and that uncertainty surrounding the European area (let alone the UK) has never been higher. Let’s see how the general elections in Spain pan out over the week-end for a start. Do not sell these tail hedges yet.
"
"Which Pound Are You looking At?. When he said this morning that “the pound is stable, markets are stable”, I am not sure which pound and which markets Boris Johnson was referring to. Traders have had three days to digest the Brexit vote, and they punished the British pound by sending it another 3% lower today against the US dollar and against the Euro. They also punished UK banks by sending their stocks another 10 to 15% lower, after having already marked them down on Friday by a similar amount. The same pattern was obvious in credit as well. Financials underperformed other sectors (the fair value of iTraxx Financials Senior was 10.8bps wider at 133bps, compared with a 5.4bps widening of iTraxx Main’s fair value at 98bps), and UK banks underperformed other financial institutions. We have seen some profit taking by investors holding short risk positions and it has so far helped to contain the move wider, but the reality continues to kick in and the inherent uncertainty of Brexit is not going to go away anytime soon. We are in unchartered territory and it is difficult to imagine the risk premia’s widening ending in the very short term.
"
"Unusually Unusual. Over the last three sessions, the credit market has experienced some pretty extraordinary moves. The day Brexit was announced, iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) opened at 435bps, 100bps wider than the its previous close, which was a 30% increase of its risk premium. iTraxx Main (ITXEB) opened 30bps wider, which represented a 40% widening. In such unusual circumstances, one would have expected bases – the difference between indices and the theoretical values computed with the risk premia of their constituents – to be all over the place, and effectively to be more positive by a fair amount - indices are the most liquid instruments and the most recognised hedge and hence are expected to react faster than single reference entity CDS -. But none of that happened. The bases stayed in check and remained contained for every single index, in Europe and in the US alike. At most we have seen a continuation of the normalising trend which bases have followed since the beginning of the year. These are unusual unusual times.
"
"Aspirin for everyone. Just after London close,  the BoE signaled rate cuts over the summer. At the same time the ECB announced it was looking at increasing the pool of QE eligible assets as the Brexit is depleting the asset pool.  Central banks are using the usual pills to calm the market fever. Post London closing credit index are squeezing much tighter and the iTraxx Europe credit index  is now only 5bps wider than its pre-Brexit levels trading at 80bps. Brexit chaos looks like a Brexit cough,  far away from the state of mind of most European citizens apprehensive about their future.   Credit shorts had a short glory and credit long had a  long stress over the last seven days. The risk management of this week where large volumes of credit derivatives indices have traded will be decisive for the year performance.
"
"It Never Happened. On the eve of the results of the referendum which took place last Thursday in the UK, people were slightly worried that almost no probability of a Brexit appeared to be priced in the credit market. One week on, and maybe it was fully priced in after all… After an initial kneejerk reaction which sent iTraxx Main (ITXEB) to 105bps and iTraxx Crossover to 435bps, both indices are roughly back to the closing levels of the 23rd June at 79bps and 346bps respectively. iTraxx Financials Senior, which was supposed to be most at risk, only suffered marginally more  and its risk premium difference with ITXEB has gone from 21bps to 25bps. In credit, it is as if Brexit never happened. Other asset classes do not necessarily tell the same story. Interest rates are at their lowest levels in Europe and in the UK. The British Pound has not been able to stage any sustainable rebound against the USD nor against the Euro and is stuck at its lowest levels in years. It is possible to patch that together if one believe central banks are still almighty. But, if the rationale of credit investors is just that a trick will be found to ignore the result of the referendum, they are probably in for a rude awakening at some later stage during the summer.

"Italian Banks Are Back In The Frame. Activity was a bit patchy as was expected on Independence Day. With US investors out for the day, markets struggle to find a clear direction after the impressive rally which took place from Tuesday onwards last week. One headline caught people’s attention though. The European Central Bank has asked MONTE ( Banca Monte dei Paschi  ) to cut more than €14Bln of gross non-performing loans over 3 years. Selling such a large stock of soured loans could lead the bank to seek additional capital that investors are not available to provide. This underscores the difficulty of the weakest Italian banks and adds pressure to the industry. The rest of the Italian banks were generally weaker, and that soon affected all peripheral names, and eventually all the banks which outperformed last week, particularly the UK ones.
"
"Back To Negative Bases . After last week’s rally, investors have been happy to let some protection go in the consolidation that took place over the last couple days. They have used this pop wider to lighten up hedges on iTraxx Financials Senior, iTraxx Main and iTraxx Crossover. But what is true for credit indices appears less obvious on single name CDS, and some compartments of the market have been put under pressure. The reach for protection that started on Italian banks yesterday spread out to other peripheral names and UK institutions. In fact, everything related to the UK saw its risk premium increased today as uncertainties associated with Brexit came back with a bang. Following the English pound which touched new lows against most currencies, all UK names were indicated wider. So much so, that index bases have resumed their march into negative territory on European indices across the board. 
"
"It Does Not Look Healthy. Financials are the focal point of everybody’s attention at the moment. DB ( Deutsche Bank AG ) attracted some of the limelight today as its stock reached a new all time low and is now under threat of being dropped from the Eurostoxx 50. Its 5 year risk premium is now back to the widest levels of the year. But the hot potato at the moment is MONTE ( Banca Monte dei Paschi  ). Its 5 year risk premium was another 19bps wider at 603bps, as a credit event is fast becoming a distinct possibility. Headlines quoting the president of the Eurogroup as suggesting that institutional investors may take a greater hit than retail holders in any bail-in when he said “authorities are allowed to take additional measures in case of a bail-in to assist vulnerable groups” did nothing to reassure them. Effectively, even more striking than the 5 year CDS widening is the flattening of the curve on the short end. Near term worries are obvious when you consider that 1 year protection has widened almost 200bps more than 5 year protection during the last week, and is now roughly trading at the same level. That move is the vertical pin you can see on the right end side of this grapple.
"
"Some Sense Finally Emerging. Following last week price action which left quite a few people scratching their head with regards to the strength of credit, things are gradually coming back into place, and it is possible to make sense out of the recent price action. iTraxx Main (ITXEB) is still anchored towards the bottom of its range, which is consistent with the ECB buying European credit “en masse”. iTraxx Crossover is drifting wider steadily and decompressing compared with ITXEB, which is consistent with a smaller inclusion in the CSPP and a bigger sensitivity to UK names (they are the widest constituents by a fair margin). iTraxx Financials Senior (ITXES) is back to its widest levels compared with ITXEB (the spread between the two indices stand at 36bps when it was down to 23bps last week), which is consistent with UK institutions under pressure after the Brexit and its disastrous impact on real estate funds, with the Italian banks at recent wides following the woes of MONTE ( Banca Monte dei Paschi  ), and with DB ( Deutsche Bank AG ) recent struggles. iTraxx Financials Subordinated is underperforming ITXES, as subordinated bond holders are first in line if bail in clauses were triggered among the weakest banks.

"Chapatte's Theorem. Former racing cyclist and journalist, Robert Chapatte, used to say, during a cycling race, if a rider escaped alone comes with a minute ahead of his immediate pursuers ten kilometers to the finish  line, he shall win the race.  We could apply the theorem to the credit market race. If an index has tightened (resp. widened) 10bps faster than the pack of single names  one hour before the market close  the index basis  will close much more negative (resp. more positive). The credit indices have been strong all day long and never gave up their advance on single names. The credit index bases, especially the Crossover basis, are closing very negative across the board. 
"
"All Bulled Up. The credit market enjoyed a positive session today. The bar was set pretty high on Friday, but investors did not blink and they pushed risk premia even tighter across the board. The positive tone begun in Asia where Japan’s PM Shinzo Abe’s coalition won the upper house election and secured a comfortable majority with his coalition partners. Developments in UK politics where Andrea Leadsom quit the race for the Tory leadership and cleared the way for Theresa May to become UK’s next prime minister were taken as a sign that the political turmoil is easing and interpreted bullishly. Most credits benefitted, and, unsurprisingly, UK related names which have been punished recently outperformed. In some instances, combined with company specific news, it led to some outsized gain. VUECIN’s (Vougeot) 5 year CDS tightened by 30bps at 367bps as Odeon was rumoured to be in advanced takeover talks. MTNLN’s (Matalan) 5 year CDS tightened by 4.5pts upfront after the company published decent first quarter results. 
"
"Time For Relative Value?. During the Brexit led sell-off, which arguably lasted 72 hours, iTraxx Main (ITXEB) underperformed CDX IG, with the ITXEB-CDXIG spread moving from flat to +8bps on the 27th June. From then onwards, it has been one-way traffic, and the rally that followed has not only brought all indices through their pre-Brexit levels, but it has also pushed ITXEB almost down to the same level as CDXIG. They closed tonight at 71bps and 70bps respectively. Based on that, it is hard to imagine that worries around the Italian banking sector have been on the rise, and that bail-in is still a distinct possibility. As it stands, challenges facing European credits do not attract a big risk premium, and some are beginning to argue that it is time go short risk in Europe and buy protection on ITXEB, while going long risk in the US and selling protection on CDXIG. During the February sell-off which had nothing to do with European systemic risk, ITXEB widened 32bps from 94bps to 126bps compared to 22bps in CDXIG which went from 104bps to 126bps. Imagine what could happen if the market decides to stop pricing out Brexit…
"
"Another Day, Another Question. Financials have attracted a lot of attention recently. The UK banks have been in the spotlight since polls started to indicate a closer Brexit race than initially anticipated. Italian banks have been talked about on the back of their non-performing loan exposure, particularly after MONTE ( Banca Monte dei Paschi  ) was asked by the ECB to cut such holdings by €14Bln by 2018. Today brought more question marks after DNB’s earning miss. It took investors’ focus back on European banks on- and off-balance sheet exposures to the energy sector. DNB higher provisions may indicate that other banks will also need to increase theirs on non-investment grade energy exposures and the charge the company took on Shipping & Offshore highlighted how legacy shipping exposure remains a key source of risk to certain banks. RBS, STANLN (Standard Chartered), INTNED (ING), CMZB (Commerzbank) and DANBNK (Danske Bank) all saw their 5-year CDS caught a bid.
"
"Does Anyone Care About The BoE?. It was a fairly subdued session and there was not an awful lot a volume going through. Most clients are buyers of risk and most dealers do not want to offer it, which translates into a stalemate situation even though the tone was definitely strong. The bullish sentiment which lasted throughout the day was a bit surprising considering that the BoE left rates unchanged while most observers had expected an easing of some form. They had to make do with minutes of the meeting that definitely read like “cutting” minutes: “To that end, most members of the Committee expected monetary policy to be loosened in August”. The BoE hinted previously that would tailor a response to the world that emerges post Brexit, and the markets have given them an opportunity not to rush given the recent rally.
"
"The Week That Was. Volumes stood well below their average today, particularly in Europe where people were probably still in shock after the terror attack that took place overnight in Nice in the South of France. It was a calmer end to a tumultuous week, which saw risky assets post an impressive performance across the board. Risk premia are tight in synthetic products. Except for iTraxx Financials which still have some ground to cover, credit indices are flirting with their tightest levels of the year. Levels are tight, but the move is driven by cash products, for which buying continues while primary deals are drying out. Without any primary supply in sight, even if one might expect the tightening trend to abate somewhat, one should not expect any blow out amidst the presence of CSPP. In any case, if the ECB action was not enough, it looks as if the BOE stands ready to act at it next meeting in three-week time. 
"
"Geopolitics. Since Thursday night, markets have had to cope with the tragic events in Nice and Turkey. Whilst both disturbing, events in Turkey had the most potential to be a major macro event. The apparent quick resolution of the attempted coup on Friday night will probably be enough to limit its impact though. In late trading on Friday, the Turkish lira was down in excess of 5% against the dollar, its biggest decline since the financial crisis in 2008. At the end of today’s session, the lira’s fall was limited to slightly more than 2% since just before the coup emerged, with the crackdown on those involved well under way. In creditland, while indices felt a tad weak, moves were minimal. There was some action on TURKEY’s CDS though, which is among the most liquid sovereign names. Unsurprisingly, TURKEY’s 5 year risk premium was under pressure. It opened 20bps wider right out of the gate, and spent the day wrapped around 250bps.
"
"Is Brexit Good For Some?. Japan woke up this morning to the tune of M&A; after a three-day-week-end. Japanese telecom group SOFTBK ( SoftBank Group Corp  ) is offering a 43% premium to Friday’s close to acquire  ARM Holdings Plc , a UK mobile industry leader, for £24.3Bln. The bumper deal would be one of the largest European technology transactions and Softbank’s largest acquisition to date. ARM derives the vast majority of its revenues from Asia and North America with clients such as Apple, Samsung Electronics or Qualcomm, and should be relatively immune from Brexit. So the main impact of the coming UK’s exit from the EU at the moment is the roughly 12% fall of the British Pound against the Japanese Yen. It certainly makes the deal more attractive, but given the steady rise of ARM’s stock since the beginning of May and the hefty premium paid, the operation still means that SOFTBNK’s net debt to EBITDA could rise from 3.9 times to 4.6 times. No wonder investors pushed SOFTBNK’s 5 year risk premium 35bps wider to 155bps.
"
"Option Expiry Pain. Today was option expiry day on credit indices. July is not usually a particularly busy expiry, but this time it actually was. Some credit indices were flirting with levels corresponding to strikes with large amount of open interest. Such was the case of CDXIG526 and iTraxx Main (ITXEB525) which both traded close to 70bps and such was the case of iTraxx Financials Senior (ITXES525) which was trading around 95bps. While these levels proved sticky for most of the day, they also left dealers net buyers of protection once options expired at 4pm London time. An uptick in equity markets and a lack of conviction ahead of tomorrow’s ECB meeting was enough to convinced everybody that dumping the unwanted excess of protection was the right thing to do. This combined with a typically thin late session liquidity triggered a mini squeeze during the final hour that single names were unable to follow. Index bases finished the day deeper in negative territory.
"
"A Public Backstop Would Be “Very Useful”. The highlight of the day was always going to be the ECB meeting. On the surface it failed to deliver any real excitement. Mr Draghi made sure to mention that they would consider adding fresh stimulus later this year when a clearer picture of the economic impact from the UK’s vote to leave the European emerge. That was enough to send iTraxx Main to its tightest level of the year, but the move on the day is only 1.5bps. He also spoke about Italian banks and non-performing loans (NPLs) as questions were inevitably asked during the press conference. Mr Draghi does not think that there is a functioning market for NPLs at the moment. This probably means that a 20cts bid for Monte’s sofferenze would not be a fair market price. He was clear that he does not want banks to fire sale their NPLs and he told reporters that a public backstop would be “very useful”. That point did not escape investors, and they sent iTraxx Financial Subordinated 15.5bps tighter at 200.5bps.
"
"They Know Their Maths. Yesterday the auction to settle the pay-out of the CDS referencing PORTEL (Portugal Telecom) was held by Markit and Creditex. Bonds were valued at 20cts on the euro, which means that an investor who bought 1M€ of protection maturing after the credit event date (which was deemed to have taken place on the 20th June 2016) will get an 800k€ payment form the person who sold him protection. It was a widely anticipated auction as it will dictate the pay-out of roughly 3,000 contracts covering a nominal just shy of a €1Bln. It also meant that all the credit indices that included PORTEL when they were issued had one fewer constituent this morning. Because investors anticipated the recovery would be quite low on PORTEL, it was contributing significantly to the risk premia of many indices, and was adding anything between 25bps (for ITXEX525) to 95bps (for ITXEX517). One could have feared a pretty shambolic situation, but dealers did a good job at factoring this situation in their quotes and the Crossover bases complex remained consistent as shown by the above grapple for instance.
"
"Is It Just Oil?. It really felt like summer in the morning. Not that the weather was particularly sunny and extremely hot, but activity was subdued and risk premia were a tad tighter compared with last week’s close. In the afternoon, there was a nice bit of weakness though as the US came in. Oil sold off more than $1 which led the energy heavy CDXIG to widen in a straight line. As a result, iTraxx Main (ITXEB) was dragged wider but the move was gradual and ITXEB proved fairly resilient in the end. At the European close, at 68bps, ITXEB stood 5bps tighter than CDXIG which was trading at 73bps. That is a 2bps outperformance. But if you look a bit further, the run is more impressive: a month ago after the shock result of the referendum which pointed to Brexit, ITXEB was trading 8bps wider than CDXIG. In just 4 weeks, CDXIG has underperformed ITXEB by 13bps.
"
"How Did They Not See It Coming?. The reporting season has been in full swing over the last couple of weeks. If results have been correct (at least with what were generally lowered expectations…), they failed to make a big impression on credit investors so far. That certainly makes CMZB ( Commerzbank AG  ) the odd one out. Investors took fright as Germany’s second largest bank disclosed an unexpected drop in their common equity Tier 1 ratio, a key measure of financial strength, from 12% at the end of the first quarter to 11.5%. The decline was caused by “non-operating” valuation and methodology effects. Model adjustments only rarely have such an impact, and people were left wondering why the company did not see it coming. They pushed CMZB’s 5-year-risk premium 8bps wider at 123bps at some stage. It also impacted DB ( Deutsche Bank AG ) which reports tomorrow. Generally speaking that put pressure on the whole banking sector, and the spread differential between iTraxx Financial Senior and iTraxx Main reached 30bps during the morning before settling at 27bps at the close, up from 25.5bps yesterday.
"
"Depressing Oil. The reporting season continues and, as there was not much in terms of macro news with the FOMC concluding tonight after the close of the European Market, investors paid some attention. STL ( Statoil  ) reported worse than expected Q2 adjusted earnings of $913m, and cut its 2016 capital spending to $12bn from $13bn previously. The company reported an unexpected loss and its CEO said that “the results were strongly affected by weak oil and gas markets”. As there is no sign of oil prices rebounding meaningfully any time soon (higher than expected US inventory reports sent the barrel down more than 2.5% today, below $42), investors were quick to extrapolate what the impact could be on other oil-related companies. STL saw its risk premium jump 8bps to 54bps, and the energy sector was the worst performing today. It was actually the only one wider at the end of the session.
"
"Accounting.... Over the last few sessions, Japanese risky assets have benefitted from the announcement by PM Shinzo Abe of an economic stimulus package worth over 28tTrnY. One can only wonder what would have happened to CITOH ( Itochu Corp  ) under normal circumstances then. Yesterday, an activist short-seller research group published a report criticizing the trading company’s accounting and said it would “likely become the next Japanese company to be forced to restate its financials”, questioning the treatment of 3 investments, most notably a stake in a Colombian coal mine. The company swiftly issued a statement saying that CITOH follows correct accounting procedures and that its financial statement are approved by outside auditors. Other analysts commented that the report had not brought any new information and that these facts were already known. Nevertheless, that was enough to make CITOH the worst performing stock in the Nikkei 225 and sent its 5-year-risk premium 14bps wider to 57bps, even though it stabilised somewhat today.
"
"The Week That Was. It was not the most eventful week and it definitely had a summer feel about it. Trading ranges were fairly tight and traded volumes are fading a bit. But the above grapple sums up pretty well what were the main themes. On the one hand, oil had another leg down and, with a slightly more than 20% drop since its June 8th intraday high, it is back in bear market territory. It weighted on the results of the major European oil companies which were reported this week, and the sector which can be found in bottom left corner underperformed the rest of the market. These traditionally low beta names all ended 15bps wider in an otherwise stable market. On the other hand, peripheral banks had a positive run going into the results of the stress test which will be released tonight. MONTE was the standout outperformer, as it was rumoured to be on the verge of finalizing a consortium of 8 banks to guarantee a €5Bln cash call it plans to carry out.
"
"Sell The Rumour, Buy The Fact. After the results of the European banks stress tests on Friday, many expected a bullish price action on the financial sector. And it is what we actually got first thing this morning. But as the morning wore on, profit takers soon showed up in the market and flows became fairly balanced. After their initial tightening, banks’ risk premia soon stabilised and they eventually closed off their tightest levels across the board. If almost all the banks showed resilience in the stress test adverse scenario, some investors see execution risks in MONTE’s ( Banca Monte dei Paschi  ) right issue. In addition, MONTE has now created a precedent setting a price of its NPL portfolio at 33cts on the euro under the terms of the bail out. Other Italian banks with large NPL books, most notably UCGIM ( UniCredit SpA  ), could announce they have further write-downs to take on these already depressed assets.
"
"Random Walk Or Drift Wider?. Since mid-July, the price action on credit indices has been pretty benign and it says it all that today’s move on iTraxx Main (+3.5bps) has been the biggest over that period. During the last 9 sessions though, it seems that the credit market is edging a bit wider in the US and in Europe alike. It all feels a bit like “déjà vu”. Europe has to deal with renewed weakness in the banking sector, where long risk positions were unwound following the stress test results. This weakness was confirmed today by the profit warning of CMZB ( Commerzbank AG  ) and rumours that UCGIM ( UniCredit SpA  ) could need an additional €5.5Bln capital requirement to cover the gap resulting from repricing its non-performing loans portfolio leading to a potentially crowded round of capital raising comes September. The US have to deal with their heavy exposure to the energy sector, with oil dipping below $40 per barrel. We will need more than a few days to know whether that risk premia’s move off their tightest levels of the year can be put down to thin summer liquidity and is just a blip, or if it is the beginning of a more serious repricing.
"
"FIAT On The Move. Even if daily changes were minimal today, there was a bit of volatility. After a cautious opening that pushed credit indices wider, the rest of day was spent grinding back to yesterday’s closing level, leaving the market with a positive tone at the close. A few stories also contributed to the better tone, among them the news than SAMSNG ( Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  ) would be in advance talks to buy some or all of FIAT’s ( Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV  ) auto-parts unit Magneti Marelli in a deal that could be worth in excess of $3Bln. While the results published last week or the US sales figures released yesterday failed to trigger any genuine excitement among credit investors, the perspective of a lower debt pile helped them send FIAT’s 5-year-risk-premium 18bps tighter at 399bps.
"
"Scarce Paper Just Became Scarcer. In the plate spinning competition that central banks have almost all entered around the world, there was a new twist today. The Bank of England announced a rate cut bringing interest rate to their lowest level ever at 0.25%. They also said their asset purchase program would increase GBP60Bln to GBP425Bln. As soon as the news hit the tape, it gave a further boost to the market was already benefiting from the positive tone which prevailed at the close yesterday. The new QE program of th BoE will include a corporate bucket, and cash which had been hard to come by in Europe since the ECB launched the CSPP just became even scarcer. If every credit joined the party, UK names benefited the most. Because they represent a large contingent in iTraxx Main, they helped outperform other indices 
"
"Back To The Tights. Days during which Non-Farm Payroll statistics are published are not known to be the busiest. Before they are made public, no one really wants to take any meaningful position, as the risk of being wrong footed is important, and after they are released, the week-end is dangerously close and who knows what might happen when markets are closed for 48 hours. Today was no exception and volumes were anaemic, but if credit indices traded sideways in the morning, they rallied in the afternoon on the back of better NFPs than investors had anticipated. Creit indices all closed near their tightest levels of the year, and the short term momentum favours the bulls at the moment. The charge tighter was led by UK names which outperformed once again on the back of the bond buying program announced yesterday by the BoE, even if, in the financial space, disappointing earnings from RBS checked the rally somewhat.
"
"A New Start for Isolux. The Credit Derivatives Determination Committee ruled last Friday that a Bankruptcy Credit Event occurred with respect to ISOLUX (Grupo Isolux Corsan Finance B.V.). The Spanish engineering and construction company is defaulting on 850M Eurobond issued in 2014 and multiple credit facilities. Some creditors will own between 90% and 95% of the company according to the restructuring agreement. The Isolux CDS did not trade during the financial crisis. It started to trade in October 2014.It was one the new high yield CDS added to the iTraxx Europe Crossover Series 22. The CDS started to trade around 600bps with an implied 5Y default probability at 40%. The premium kept widening over the last 2 years with ups and downs according to cash generated from assets’ sale, IPO and corruption scandals. After all, investors are paying the price for heavy investments in solar energy in 2007 and 2008 when solar energy was still heavily subsidised in Spain.
"
"The Summer Time for Casino is Cloudy. Casino CDS was volatile today, wider by 30bps during the day. The CDS closed at 285bps on the standard 5Y CDS, 10bps wider than yesterday. At the end of July, the 1H earnings’ release eased a little bit the investors’ concern with better French operations. The challenge for the next quarters remains high in order to reach Casino’s EBIT target. At 3%, Casino EBITDA margin is still 50% too low compared to large competitor like Carrefour or Tesco, 3% versus 4.5%. The mood is bearish. The  CDS market had difficulties in recycling the clients flows buying protections. The fundamental on Casino are not easy to assess. The Casino business portfolio is large and complex. For those on holidays in France, you will shop most likely at the local Spar. Spar France was bought in 1997 by Casino. This could be surprising for some reader from northern Europe. So is the complexity of Groupe Casino's organisation.
"
"A 35% Rally Deserves a Break. The iTraxx Europe Series 25 bounced back today from its yearly low from 65bps to 68bps.  Real money investors are taking some chips off the table. The latest statistics published by DTCC are showing a reduction of clients’ long risk positions in credit indices over the last week. The European investment grade index rally is having a break after a 35% rally from its 100 spike at the end of June as you can see on the impressive attached grapple. Being long risk at current level is offering a limited upside. However, the credit cash market is still rock solid. The iShares Core GBP Corporate ETF (SLXX) was up 0.5% again today, 18% this year. If rates are going higher spreads are expected to tighten and vice versa if rates are going lower spread are expected to widen. Any weakness of synthetic products would be awkward in the current environment.
"
"One swallow does not a Summer Make ... But Hellenic Telecom’s (OTE) latest earnings are encouraging for the Greek economy. OTE is seeing some stabilization in Greece with improvements in high speed broadband services and pay-tv. Mobile revenues are sliding but at a moderate pace.  In the second quarter, OTE is making a net profit and will pay taxes to its second largest shareholder, the Greek government which owns 10% of the company.  Deutsche Telekom is its biggest shareholder with 40% of the shares.  However, paying corporate taxes is not enough. The Greek government views Telecommunications as a cash cow. An increased levy on mobile services and imposing a tax on pay-TV will weigh on sentiment and could send the swallow back to warmer countries. The CDS has rallied a lot since the July 2015 Greece crisis as can be seen on the attached grapple. Trading at 250, the market keeps seeing OTE as a recovery story.
"
"Soft is the sweet spot, so far ... Soft commodities, such as sugar and nuts, recently have had a very good run compared to hard commodities such as metals, coal and power. Sugar is up 30% this year (50% over a year) whilst hard commodities are just recovering . The fate of two Singapore-based commodity traders mirrors this divergence: Noble Group, the hard commodity trader, is struggling with a CDS trading at 30% upfront over a 5%  coupon, while for Olam International, the soft commodity trader, credit premium is around 2.5%bps.  In Europe, Suedzucker AG had an impressive rally  as can be seen on the attached Grapple; the rally is highly related to the evolution of sugar prices over the last year. Suedzucker AG CDS is the best performer of our investment grade universe over this period, 80bps tighter. Its equity price is up 70% over the same period. We could be close to the end of this run with more supply and European deregulation. One equity analyst cut his recommendation and the stock was down 6% early in the session, recovering during the day. We know we are eating too much sugar, but we cannot stop eating it. However, in the short term, the market will want us to eat as much as sugar as an Olympic athlete to keep Suedzucker in a sweet spot.

"Are the pizzas burning?. Pizza Express is a quality pizza restaurant chain in the UK founded in 1965 and being bought by a China-bases private equity firm in 2014. The CDS is trading since September 2014 in conjunction with the just issued high yield debts financing the acquisition.  The CDS is in the iTraxx Europe Crossover since the Series 22.  The 5y CDS is trading at 700bps and is trending higher since December 2016 as the attached grapple shows. The restaurant chain sector is struggling globally with intense competition and changes in food consumption. You can make cash flow projection on yours market share off the 4kg of pizza eaten in the UK per year and per person, the recent market growth is more on takeaway than dining. Pizza Express market positioning is asking for changes or its pizzas will burn.

"Long Lost Brothers Reunified. Linde AG and Praxair Inc are working at a merger of equals. Carl von Linde created the eponymous company at the end of the 19th century. He was a German professor working on refrigeration and developed industrial processes for refrigeration, gas liquefaction and separation. Georges Claude, a French engineer, developed at the beginning of the 20th century a competing process source of Air Liquide SA worldwide development. Carl Von Linde created a second company in the US which turned independent during the first world war, Praxair was born.  Linde merging with Praxair will reduce air gas suppliers to three majors controlling more than 75% of the industrial gas worldwide. After a few buoyant years for Linde, the company is struggling with industrial gas on the decline and with hardly compensating healthcare gas development. The merger is obvious for cost cutting and for increasing pricing power but the regulatory hurdle will be hard to pass.  The equity market is applauding the merger. Linde stock price is closing up 10%. The CDS is unchanged trading already at very tight level around 35bps.  This merger is not a done deal. The benefit for the consumers is not obvious.  Only more R&D; could make sense. Using good old thermodynamics, these companies are very active on R&D.; Air Liquide is applying for more than 300 patents a year. Surprising for just compressing gas in a bottle….
"
"A European Brownian Bridge. Today, the iTraxx Europe Investment grade index and the iTraxx Europe Crossover index have both build a Brownian bridge over a one-year period. They were trading at 68bps and 314bps respectively the 14th of august last year, and they are closing at 68bps and 314bps tonight. An investor being long risk will have made money on his investment with the carry and the roll down. Financials indices bridge is still under construction. The senior index is 13bps wider and the subordinated is 42bps wider. You have to mind the gap on financials credits. Nevertheless, the 5 years forward average value of the Europe credit risks is back to where it was a year ago. We had a real random walk over the last year but we are back to the same levels.  Compared to last year, the trend is different. The long term trend was on rising CDS premium, the recent dynamic is on CDS premium tightening.  Today was for once a weaker session, financials leading the way wider, but post European market close the US market is trading better. Hard to say if we are on a turning point but at least we expect to comment next year on any European Brownian bridge.

"Financial Cooling. Galapagos Holding  is a German industrial group servicing the heavy industry with three subsidiaries: Kelvion  - specialized in heat exchangers -, Enexio - specialized in power cooling -  and DencoHappel – specialized in air filtration -. To be more familiar with these businesses, you can attend Chillventa – the exhibition for energy efficiency, heat pumps and refrigeration next October in Nurenberg. This companies were bought by  Triton, the private equity fund, in 2014. Triton is active in restructuring its portfolio of industrial companies. DencoHappel will be sold to Flakt Woods, just bought by Triton. Flakt Woods is a Swedish company specialized in industrial air handling units. The proceeds of DencoHappel's sale  will cool a lot Galapagos credit risk even if Galapagos will lose some diversification being focused on heat and cooling systems which sales have been declining recently. However, as you can see on the attached grapple, the 5Y CDS tightened 6 points (around 200bps). The CDS is trading since 2014, when Triton bought the companies. It could be an orphan CDS if Triton keeps restructuring its portfolio or go to hard default if the business is turning sour.  CDS on LBO structures are used to have a quick binary outcome, well ahead of the 5Y standard CDS maturity, orphaning or defaulting. We can expect more cooling and heating stories from Galapagos in the years to come.

"Tailwind for Emerging Markets. Looking and exploring the emerging market machine’s cluster of DataGrapple, we observe the impressive trend of emerging markets performance since February this year, Venezuela excepted.  With 10Y Treasuries anchored under 1.60%, the investors’ concern on Emerging Market keeps easing.  According to Bank of America, with 20BUSD of positive inflows over the past 7 weeks, the Emerging Market debt funds keep attracting investors.  The largest strike on record. On the equity side, we have the same trend, 7 weeks of inflows with a total of 15BUSD.  Investors are chasing yield and growth. Shorting the emerging market risk with CDS looks risky, there is more room to trade back to 2014 levels, Brazil CDS is still trading at 250 for a 130-150 range in 2014.  However, Asian and East European countries are trading at the tightest or close to their tightest level over the last 3 years. We can be close to the final leg of the EM CDS tightening.

"“Elephants in a Funnel”. The airlines sector is one of the worst performing equity sectors since the beginning of the year. In Europe, the 5 airlines stocks members of the STOXX Europe 600 are all down by more than -20% this year - Easyjet being the worst performer at -40%, while Ryanair is the best performer down -20%. We have the same picture for all flag carriers worldwide.  Last week, Cathay Pacific reported weak earnings due to disappointing passenger traffic numbers. In Europe, Air-France KLM CDS premium has risen from a low at 250bps at the beginning of March to 460bps at today’s close -  as the attached Grapple displays.  IAG and Lufthansa CDS have been so far stable on the CDS side. Air-France KLM is struggling with larger costs than most of its competitors. However, the industry is struggling with way too optimistic traffic forecasts against more circumspect travelers - leisure and business included. Airlines are very sensitive to growth expectations; some may not be able to survive a global traffic reduction.

"Genetically Modified Organization. Bayer is moving ahead with Monsanto merger to create a one shop, from crop chemicals to seeds. This move is in many aspects controversial. Selling the same seed to the whole planet is against the best rule of any risk management: diversification and in this case more precisely bio-diversification. French winegrowers were happy to use the American grape resistant to the phylloxera at the end of the 19th century when all French vineyards were devastated. The basis of consolidation - one product for all -  is adding risks with a reduction of farmer’s suppliers. But, this merger is not about risk reduction. Buying Monsanto all cash, Bayer has already secured a 60BEUR credit facility. This is against the rules of “Through the Cycle” resilience. Bayer was used to be a AA rated company and it is now close to be downgraded to BBB. The CDS has moved wider today closing at 58bps (+5bps). Bayer CDS was  trading at 25bps in March 2015. However, with the ECB eager to buy corporate bonds the move wider could not last long.

"Heatwave is Slowing Down the Credit Market. With the heatwave and the coming long weekend in London, investors found an excuse for staying on the sideline on credit indices. The realized volatility is going down over the last four weeks. The iTraxx Main has just traded in a 5bps range over this period, between 65bps and 70bps, with no trend and little volatility. The credit market is constructive especially on the cash product. The day of Isolux CDS auction - which settled at 15.75% - the financial sector was well supported. Portugal will recapitalize its state-owned bank Caixa Geral de Depositos with 2.7BEuros. Including additional subordinated debt, the plan is close to 5BEuros. The commitment represents close to 3% of Portuguese GDP.  This plan is expected to stabilize the Portuguese banking system. The credit market does like more equity in the system. There is no reason to trade wider at the movement. However, risk addition at the current levels does not look very compelling for many investors. The credit index market is in the doldrums.

"Under the Sombrero. Investors are still awake and are keeping an eye open. Tomorrow, Janet Yellen will deliver a speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. The central bankers will hear contributions on “Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future"".  The topic is interesting as the central bankers have chosen over the past years  the path of innovative monetary policies.  The pursuit of innovation and resilience is possible but at a cost of trials and errors. There could be some interesting academic contributions, hopefully enough to keep investors awake. As the attached grapple shows, a lot of single name CDS have hardly moved today. In Europe, only some high yield names are tightening with comforting earnings while in the US some energy names are weaker with oil price consolidation. 
"
"Saga dos Bancos. After Portugal’s state-owned bank Caixa Geral de Depositos’ recapitalization plan early in the week, we had a brief respite on the Portuguese banks. However, the situation at Banco Novo is unclear. Banco Novo is the good bank created in August 2014 out of Banco Espirito Santo (BES) - transferring BES’s good assets.  Two years later, Banco Novo’s short dated senior debt is now trading at distressed levels - around 70cts on the dollar. The CDS is trading at 30% upfront plus 5% for a one year protection. This CDS is one of the most technical and, let’s say, controversial special situations of the CDS market, with contracts outstanding under 2 different rules (2003 and 2014) already offering different definitions of what constitutes a credit event not to mention the further complication even if under 2014 rules of what is determined to be a Government intervention or not (ref Banco Novo transfer of bonds announced end-15)). According to the attached Grapple, the probability of a credit event within a year has moved from 25% to 50% over the last month. The situation is turning sour. For an outsider, buying a pool of assets from a distressed bank is an investment decision whilst buying a distressed bank’s stress resilience could be more like an act of faith.

"Bankers Are Busy. It has been by far the quietest summer in recent years. Brexit failed to provide the excitement that Greece, China or the taper tantrum did. Today was another day where variations were capped at 3bps across all credit indices, investment grade and high yield alike. Single reference CDS were no different and, barring a slight outperformance of financials as UCGIM ( UniCredit SpA  ) is looking into a potential €20Bln of NPL sale, they also experienced minimal moves. It does not mean that the credit market is asleep though. Over the last couple of days, substantial amount of bonds have been issued by corporates. Yesterday almost $8Bln were issued in the US among 4 issuers. Today in Europe more than €3.5Bln were brought to the market, and all deals achieved impressive terms: Coca-Cola issued €500m 20 year bonds at mid-swap + 45bps (that compares with an earlier indicative terms of MS +60/65bps); Evonik priced €650m 4.5 year bonds at MS +20bps (vs their early indicative MS +30bps), €750m 8 year bonds at MS +35bps (vs their early indicative MS +45bps) and €500m of 12 year bonds at MS +45bps (vs their early indicative MS +55/60bps); KPN sold €625m 8.5 year bonds at MS +60bps (vs their early indicative MS +75/80bps) and €625m 12 year bonds at MS +80bps (vs their early indicative MS +100bps).
"
"The March Towards Zero. We have already highlighted how low the volatility has been throughout the summer. Since the 12th July, the S&P; has not experienced a daily variation in excess of 1%, and it has remained in a 1.8% trading range. The very same was true for credit, with iTraxx Main (ITXEB) in Europe and CDXIG in the US staying in a 6bps corridor over that period. iTraxx Crossover had no daily variation bigger than 9bps, and the European high yield benchmark stayed in a 27bps range during these 7 weeks. With the market at a standstill, dealers have had plenty of time to adjust valuations, and it is therefore not entirely surprising that bases (difference between the quoted values of credit indices and the theoretical value computed with the levels of their individual constituents) have all converged towards zero, while they were at very negative levels earlier in the year. There is reason to think that the next few months will see more action (we could get rate hikes, more central banks activity; we will have a CDS rolls in 3 weeks; there is a busy political agenda around the globe), arbitragers certainly do hope so. 
"
"CDS Can Move... But It Needs A Reason. Since the beginning of 2016, oil has already been twice in bull run (commonly defined as a move in excess of 20% from the trough) and once in a bear run. The 12% down move since mid-August is bringing WTI close to its second bear market of the year, and it begins to impact energy related companies, which have been under pressure over the last few sessions. CDS price action has been subdued but hybrid debt instruments have been marked down as a result. That makes REPSM’s ( Repsol SA ) CDS 14bps tightening today even more remarkable. REPSM and Caixa SA own respectively 30% and 34% of GASSM ( Gas Natural SDG SA ). The companies confirmed to the Spanish market authority that they are in talks with private equity groups to sell about 10% of GASM’s shares each. The sale could value the 20% combined stake at about €4Bln. Even though REPSM added that “this analysis is in a preliminary phase”, it is consistent with the slashing of spending and asset sales that oil companies have had to undertake to adapt to the rout in crude prices of the last couple of years.

"Hanjin's Default Is Making Wave. CMA CMG was introduced in the iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) index for the first time in March this year. It was one of the new entrants in the series 25. Since then, it has never been the darling of the credit market. While the 5 year risk premium of ITXEX25 barely moved since its launch (it went from 296bps to 310bps), the 5 year CDS of CMA CGM went from 965bps to 1363bps at the close tonight. Insuring $1m of debt for 5 years costs you 26cts upfront (and a quarterly premium of 1.25cts afterwards), that is up 1ct compared with yesterday. Indeed, CMA CGM is reporting tonight and investors’ nerves are tested by Hanjin Shiping Co, the distressed Korean container mover which filed for court protection on Wednesday. Even if CMA CGM published a notice to its customers saying that their exposure to Hanjin is limited (they work together on 5 out of 200 shipping lines), the Korean company sent a stern reminder that the industry is experiencing extreme difficulties to recover from the slump that has plagued it since the global financial crisis.
"
"Game On For IG/HY Decompression. Activity was predictably subdued with the US enjoying a 3-day week-end. Investors had one eye on the ECB meeting on Thursday though. Some uneasy short risk positions were unwound, and the credit market outperformed equities, in a reversal of the recent pattern. The investment grade space led the way, driven by Financials with some accounts reducing short risk positions in a rather illiquid market. Some reckon an extension of QE could take the form of a relaxation of the capital key which would be very supportive for Italian government bonds, easing recent concerns about the Italian banking system. Some even suspect that bonds of financial institutions could become eligible. These expectations might be a bit far-fetched, but they were certainly enough for iTraxx Financials Senior and Subordinated to outperform iTraxx Main, which in turn outperform iTraxx Crossover.
"
"Will Fresenius End Up In The Bundesbank’s Books?. On Monday night, FREGR ( Fresenius SE & Co KGaA ), Europe’s biggest publicly traded health-care provider, announced they are buying Spain based privately held hospital group Quironsalud for an estimated €5.76Bln. Despite being predominantly debt funded -  FREGR intend to issue bonds with a 10 to 15-year maturity, on which the company expects to pay interest in the region of 2% -, the transaction will use the headroom available under current rating and should not push the company into junk category, a must to count among their debtholders the one with the deepest pockets, the ECB. At the moment, all FREGR’s bonds are among the €100Bln “eligible bonds” - i.e. which comply with the CSPP criteria – that the ECB cannot buy because of technicalities. Indeed, none of them are on the ECB collateral list, which is a prerequisite for the ECB to start buying. We can bet that the newly issued debt will only comprise “New Global Notes”, the required format to be included in the ECB collateral framework. That would certainly help them achieve their interest rate target, which is fairly ambitious for a BBB- company.
"
"Investment Grade Status Matters. Bond issuance is on course to break record since the end of the holiday season, and today saw more corporates try and take advantage of record low borrowing costs. Among companies aiming to tap investors’ liquidity, Schaeffler AG marketed €2.5Bln so-called payment in kind debt - which give it the option to pay interest with more debt – that will have maturities of 5, 7, and 10 years. The deal will enable the company to refinance the existing debt of IHO, the holding company of the group, and intends to reduce the indebtedness at Schaeffler AG by roughly €700Bln. Moody’s swiftly upgraded the company to investment grade, and investors send SHAEFF’s (Schaeffler Finance B.V.) 5-year risk premium 30bps tighter to 105bps.
The broader market experienced another strong session on balance, even if credit indices are closing off their tightest levels led by some weakness in the US. For now, iTraxx Main has still not broken the 65 level, on which it has bounced a few times since the beginning of August. A lot of hedges have come off recently ahead of tomorrow’s ECB meeting, and it looks as if the market is expecting something from Mr Draghi, which leaves room for disappointment.

"
"Will Volvo Miss The Buses?. While everybody was waiting for the ECB’s possible QE extension this morning, it transpired in the press that VLVY ( Volvo AB ), which is evaluating its options for its bus and construction equipment businesses, would have received an offer from a major Chinese company. The paper did not go so far as naming the bidder, but the truck market has experienced a brutal decline over the last 12 months, particularly in the US where VLVY is a major player, and the perspective of some assets sale was music to the ears of investors. They sent VLVY’s 5-year risk premium 5.5bps tighter at 81.5bps, which is the tightest it has traded in more than a year. 
Meanwhile, the broader market, which started the day on a fairly strong footing ahead of the ECB meeting, was left disappointed by Mr Draghi’s decision not to amend their current QE program. Stimulus will not be increased at this point in time, but a committee has been mandated to redesign the QE program and make it more effective. That led to a blip wider on all indices, but investors faded that move in the afternoon, and all was left from it at the end of the session is a 2bps underperformance of iTraxx Financials Senior compared with iTraxx Main. 

"
"Ready For Taper Tantrum Round 2?. We have not had such a day for a while. It never felt like the end of the world, but today’s moves caught many off guard, especially the second leg which took place once the US came in and accounted for two third of the move wider in credit indices. We saw it coming though, as until mid-week, expectations of more QE from the ECB had been building in the financial sector, where the most dubious actions were mooted. The strong tone that we had seen until Thursday lunchtime eventually gave way to a 15bps correction for iTraxx Crossover and CDX HY, and a 3bps correction for iTraxx Main and CDX IG. That said, if this move was in sharp contrast to the recent period of ultra-low volatility, it only took us back to the levels at which credit indices closed a week ago. We will get some more Fed speeches early next week. We shall see then whether investors, who went sulking following Mr Draghi’s decision, go into a full-blown taper tantrum.
"
"If The Market Were An Animal.... The credit market has very often been said to be at the forefront of financial innovation, but sometimes one can reasonably wonder whether if it is not behaving like a creature from the past. Last Friday, after the ECB left the market disappointed, credit indices were quick to react and they all reached the wider end of their recent range. In a fairly typical fashion, their constituents were far slower to get moving. They began to reprice, but less aggressively. The full extent of the move was only felt in earnest today, and all index constituents were marked meaningfully wider. The bases (difference between the quoted value of an index and the theoretical value computed with the price of its constituents), which turned positive across the board at the end of last week, were back to much flatter levels today at the close. The credit market is a diplodocus. Once its tail (the indices) is beaten, it takes some time before the information gets to its brain. It is only later that its body (the single names) starts moving.
 
Meanwhile, the broader started on the back foot in Europe after the very poor close in the US on Friday. iTraxx Main and iTraxx Crossover reached wides of 72bps (+4bps) and 335bps (+15bps), but that move was faded later in the day and they settled at 70bps and 326bps. The protection selling mainly came from people holding short risk positions booking profit. The market now feels long risk, and most of the shorts have now booked profit. The million-dollar question is now whether CTA momentum strategies start to de-risk. If they do, very few people will stand up and take the other side of the trade.

"
"Everybody To The Right… Everybody To The Left. Yesterday the whole session was spent waiting for the speech of Fed governor Brainard. After Europe went home, she stuck to her well versed dovish script and made her view clear. She said that “in the presence of uncertainty and the absence of accelerating inflationary pressures, it would be unwise for policy to foreclose the possibility of making further gains in the labour market”. That triggered a pause in the interest rate rise that begun a week ago, and went a long way in explaining the positive close in the US which led to a much better tone in Europe during the early morning session. Credit markets then spent most of the day wondering whether they should be bull or bear, and iTraxx Crossover visited a couple of times both ends of a 320/328bps range for instance. But as soon as US interest rates resumed their march higher (10y traded at 1.74% i.e. 7bps wider at the time of writing), credit indices ran away wider. For the sake of investors who recently sold volatility, let us hope that it does not trigger large outflows from credit ETF. They are indeed sensitive to both credit and rates.
"
"Moody’s Is Turning The Heat On Metro. Back in March, METFNL ( Metro AG ) announced that it would proceed with a demerger, in order to separate its food business (Food Co) from  its Consumer Electronics business (CE Co). METFNL held a conference call on the 6th September to give further details regarding the operation. All the financial liabilities of the group including bonds will be assumed by Food Co. Pension liabilities will be allocated 40% to Food Co and 60% to CE Co. Lease obligations will be 60% and 40%, and cash balances 75% and 25% respectively. Even though METFNL’s management expects both companies to maintain an investment grade rating after the spin-off, there won’t be any capital increase. That means that Food Co, due to the high debt load, will have at best weak credit metrics for its rating category and will be left with very limited financial leeway. Moody’s is understood to effectively ask the management to do more if Food Co is to be eligible for IG rating. That is probably why METFNL which will reference Food Co going forward has underperformed its peers during the last week. 
Meanwhile, the broader credit market spent another day looking at US interest rates. It dithered all session, and was unable to decide whether to go wider or tighter. Credit indices traded in a range (328/335 for iTraxx Crossover and 69/72 for iTraxx Main) and eventually closed bang in the middle of it.

"
"When A Mastodon Swallows Another One. BAYNGR (Bayer AG) finally announced yesterday its acquisition of Monsanto, after they agreed to pay $128/share which represents an enterprise value of $66bln (including roughly $9bln of debt). At the moment, BAYNGR has organised a bridge financing of $57bln. The plan is to finance part of the transaction with equity – a mandatory convertible and a right issue is scheduled -, and part with a mix of senior debt as well as corporate hybrids. Even though S1P has noted it could cut BAYNGR’s A- rating by up to 2 notches, the management believes the merged company will receive an investment grade. Investors took the side of BAYNGR. While in May - when the deal was first mooted - the 5 year risk premium jumped 9bps, it was unchanged today. To move a mastodon, it takes more than swallowing one of its congeners.
 
Meanwhile, the broader credit market was once again range bound and the variations were minimal, even though trading volumes felt healthy across the board. Credit indices closed roughly unchanged, at the wider end of the range they have been in since mid July.

"
"An Eye For An Eye, A Bank For An Apple?. A statement from DB ( Deutsche Bank AG ) last night revealed that the Department of Justice has them asked for a mind-boggling $14Bln to settle an investigation into their mortgage-backed security business. The DoJ’s opening salvo, which dwarfs the $9Bln fine imposed a few years ago on BNP, could all but sink DB. The bank has legal provisions on €5.5Bln, but only €4Bln are earmarked to cover regulatory enforcement, and they also include claims that trades by Russians broke sanctions. DB said they expect to settle for a much lower amount, but, if the DoJ decides to take a hard stance with an institution believed by many regulators to be among the worst offenders, its market capitalisation is now less than €17Bln and it means there is a limit to issuing material amounts of capital. Investors therefore pushed DB’s senior debt 5-year risk premium 15bps wider to 205bps and its subordinated debt 5-year risk premium 32bps wider to 425bps. Press articles pointing to the case being part of potential retaliation by the US over the EU’s tax demand on Apple did not help either, and there was spill over to banks that are yet to settle similar cases with the DoJ. CS (Credit Suisse Group AG) and RBS (Royal Bank of Scotland Plc) were among today’s worst performers.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market struggled again for direction, even if the pressure on financials definitely gave it a negative tone. All credit indices nudged a tad wider, despite the roll taking place next Tuesday.

"
"The Roll Is Upon Us. Tomorrow, all CDX and iTraxx indices except CDXHY will see new series issued. In Europe and Asia, series 26 will be launched, while series 27 will be launched in the US. The new “on the run” 5-year maturity will December 2021 for the next 6 months. Only minor changes will take place among index constituents. SSE Plc and Imperial Brands will replace RWE and Compass Group within iTraxx Main (ITXEB). Lufthansa, TUI, Nokia, Metsa and Unilabs will replace Alstom, Elis, UPM-Kymmene, Melia Hotels and British Airways within Itraxx Crossover (ITXEX). Energy Transfer Partners and ILFC will replace Gap and Time Warner Cable within CDXIG. The difference in risk premium between leavers and newcomers is minimal, so that the bulk of the impact of the roll on index risk premia will come from their maturity extension. If theoretical values are any guide, ITXEB Series 26 5 year should be 6bps wider than Series 25, ITXEX Series 26 5 year should be 14bps wider than Series 25, and CDXIG Series 27 5year should be 9bps wider than Series 26. Adding these amounts to Friday’s closes would have pushed credit index risk premia of the new series to levels last seen for “on the run” indices during the second half of June around the time of Brexit. Expecting yield starved investors to come and sell protection on the new credit indices first thing tomorrow morning, dealers have pre-emptively shaved a few basis points on all of them by driving current series of indices tighter across the board today.
"
"The (Bearish) Roll That Was. Risk traded sideways across most asset classes today. Both Equities and rates were broadly unchanged ahead of the Bank of Japan and Fed meetings tomorrow. It was then all the more surprising to see that the CDS roll was quite bearish in Europe. On roll days, the maturity of “on the run” contracts is extended by 6 months, but usually, when markets are not under stress, only a portion of the expected related risk premium increase is reflected in the price. This is effectively what happened on iTraxx Crossover and in the US. It was a different story for European investment grade names, particularly in the financial sector. The fair value of iTraxx Financials Senior - respectively Subordinated - Series 25 (ITXES25 - respectively ITXEU25) for the 5 year point was 1.5bps - respectively 4bps - wider while one would have expected it to be roughly 2 to 3bps - respectively 3 to 4bps - tighter. The weakness was driven by DB and MONTE. The market seems to gradually factor in the fact that the worst cannot be completely ruled out as far as they are concerned.
"
"LBO, The Return?. In an otherwise fairly uneventful session, TDCDC ( TDC A/S ) was one of the standout names, with large amounts of risk changing hands. The company just hired banks to advise on a possible improved offer by Apollo Global Management. The buyout firm made an initial approach that was rejected in July and they are considering a higher offer for the Danish phone company. Things appear to be hotting up, and, in the event of a takeover by a private equity group, the leverage would most likely increase significantly. While it is too early to speculate on a capital structure, TDCDC’s status as an investment grade company would almost certainly be at risk - some analysts speculated it could drop to B+, well into junk category -. Since these rumours begun a week ago, stock investors enjoyed a more than 10% rally, but credit investors have not had the best of rides. TDCDC’s 5-year risk premium has increased by 32bps, even if 15bps are arguably due to the roll that took place in the meantime (on the 20th September the standard 5-year maturity went from 20th June 2021 to 20th December 2021). Today’s session alone accounted for a 10bps widening from 155bps to 165bps.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market mainly traded sideways. The expiry of the credit index options failed to trigger any thrill, and investors were in wait and see mode ahead of the Fed’s decision on rate tonight.

"
"It Is Raining Main, hallelujah!. The Fed applied their perennial mantra once again yesterday: tough talking, no hiking. They once again told us that they are very close to a hike, but could not get comfortable enough to pull the trigger. On the hawkish side, there was one difference with earlier meetings, as 3 members of the board voted against the status quo. On the dovish side, the median estimate by Fed members for the number of rate hikes by the end of 2017 was lowered. The market decided to focus on the scaling back of the tightening plan, and on the Fed’s concern about market stability. The relief that no central bank will come and spoil the party for a while was obvious and drove risky assets up across the board. Credit indices took part in the general rally, and protection was far easier to buy than sell throughout the session. Once Monday’s roll is factored in, they are at their tightest levels of the year and it took some headline regarding Monte Paschi having to turn to the Italian government for state aid to prevent them from breaking out decisively out of their previous range.
"
"The week that was. On a one-week horizon, variations have been fairly contained, and the constituents of iTraxx Main eventually moved by roughly 1bp. There was some volatility though as a cautious beginning of the week gave way to an indiscriminate rally on Thursday after Fed members released their estimate for the path of rate increases, which was more benign that previously thought. This week was mostly about Financials though. Banks started on a very weak note as the market was still digesting headlines of potentially huge fines required to settle RMBS cases in the US. Then the rally monkey was let out after the FOMC, only for a big risk reversal to take place late on Thursday afternoon when Monte was rumoured to have to turn to the Italian government for state aid. From then, it was really difficult to source protection on Italian banks, particularly to insure subordinated debt which would be the first impacted in case of bail-in. In the end, banks were the big underperformers on the week.
"
"Cash Is Cheap And They Know It. Away from financials which are still attracting most of the headlines at the moment, LXSGR (Lanxess AG) was the only idiosyncratic mover in the European credit market. The German specialty chemical group agreed to buy one its smaller rivals, US based Chemtura Corp, for €2.4Bln in an all cash transaction in a bid to become a leader in the additive business. It was no secret that LXSGR has been seeking over the last few years to diversify away from synthetic rubber – a sector it dominates – and the acquisition of the lubricant additives and flame retardant specialist will do exactly that. LXSGR’s stock reacted positively and closed roughly 7% higher. Credit investors were a bit more guarded. While Moody’s said the Chemtura deal was positive for LXSGR’s risk profile and affirmed the company’s Baa3 ratings, the perspective of €1.5Bln to €2Bln of new senior and hybrid bonds soon reaching the market led them to push LXSGR’s 5-year risk premium 8bps wider to 66bps.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market was feeling weak, as financials once again weighed on sentiment after it was reported over the week-end that Mrs Merkel ruled out state aid for DB and refused to step into the bank’s legal case  with the US DoJ.

"
"The DoJ Is On A Roll. After DB, next on the US Department of Justice’s list of companies they scrutinise is apparently VW ( Volkswagen AG ). The carmaker has already agreed to pay $16.5Bln in civil litigation fines in the US after admitting last year that they had fitted their diesel cars with defeat devices designed to game environmental tests. Now, the US DoJ is allegedly assessing how big a criminal fine it should impose on VW, and it seems that the question is “how big should it be without putting the carmaker out of business”. While equity investors kept their calm, the fact that the fine may be priced to the limit of VW’s financial ability spooked the credit market, and caused a dramatic move lower in the VW hybrid complex which comprises the most junior debt instruments sending them down as much as 3pts at some stage. VW’s 5-year risk premium was inevitably impacted, and it closed 14bps wider at 122bps, its worst 1-day move since Brexit.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market experienced another weak session. The negative tone once again came from the financial sector where DB led the charge wider, sparking some demand for protection on banks. It took a headline suggesting that there could be some room for negotiation regarding DB’s fine to stop the rot in the afternoon, and that allowed credit indices to close only moderately wider (iTraxx Main +1bp at 74bps and iTraxx Crossover +5bps at 338bps).

"
"We Are In Good Shape... They Say. Over the last week, banks have grabbed a fair amount of headlines. Among them, DB ( Deutsche Bank AG ) has been particularly under the cosh following the announcement last week by the US DoJ that they intend to impose a monster $14.5Bln. Ever since, DB has been eager to turn the tide of pessimism that drove its stock to record lows and its 5-year risk premium to record high. To do so, the management tried to end speculation about their capital strength. They dismissed rumours the German bank will have to raise capital and they announced the long-awaited sale of Abbey Life Assurance for roughly £1Bln. They succeeded to some extent and move wider of their 5-year CDS took a breather today. During that period though, there was some spill over to other banks which are exposed to asset backed securities litigation in the US, and the financial sector has underperformed the broader credit market. It was especially true for the most junior debt instruments. On the above grapple, you can see that iTraxx Financials Subordinated is 17bps wider over the last 5 trading sessions, while iTraxx Main is flat.

"Insuring or Canyoning. The monoline MBIA AAA is the shadow of what it was before the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), but its CDS is still active as the company is one of the member of the CDX high yield indices, including the latest vintage, the CDX High Yield Series 27. During the GFC, a lot of investors having bought insurance contracts from MBIA on their CDO tranches used the CDS market to hedge their insurance contracts. Skilled in tour de force, the monoline achieved not to trigger a credit event. As the attached grapple displays, the CDS time series has large gaps in the premium of MBIA AAA’s CDS. MBIA has announced today that the company is selling its UK subsidiary to Assured Guarantee Corp, another monoline. The CDS upfront premium is dropping by 15% from 40% to 25%.  The company is approaching the home stretch.  If the company can restructure its remaining commitments on the Zohar II notes it will be out of the wood but it is far from a done deal. 

Meanwhile, the strength of the equity market did not spread to the CDS market where the financial sector what under pressure. The indices are closing unchanged on a weak tone.
"
"Market Distrust. “Extraordinarily volatile” would be a politically correct way to describe the financial sector today. A more prosaic way would be to compare it to a headless duck. The day started with mounting concerns about DB’s ( Deutsche Bank AG ) ability to withstand pending legal penalties, as a group of hedge funds that do business with the German bank were rumoured to have moved some of their derivatives portfolios to reduce their financial exposure to DB and avoid another Lehman moment. DB’s risk premium soared as soon as the market opened. When it surfaced in the press that the US Department of Justice would prefer to combine the settlements of DB, CS (Credit Suisse Group AG) and BACR (Barclays Plc) into a single announcement, it served to highlight that the DoJ’s focus is not only on DB and that there is a risk of the DoJ’s opening number for other being just as extreme. The spill over was instantaneous, and every single bank CDS gapped wider. More headlines eventually saved the day and prevented the market to go under: DB would be on its way to settle with the DoJ for $5.4Bln. A couple of weeks ago, it is not obvious such a headline would have triggered a 70bps tightening of DB’s subordinated debt’s risk premium…

Meanwhile, the broader credit market could not help reacting to what happened in the financial space. iTraxx Main (ITXEB) and iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) joined iTraxx Financials and reached new wides for the current series early on. Once ITXEB and ITXEX hit 76bps and 345bps respectively though, profit takers emerged and eventually brought all indices to unchanged levels, with the extra help of the late rumours regarding DB’s settlement.

"
"Compression In The Making.   Compression is one of the themes that developed in the European credit market recently. 
  Last week it had to do with financials which have underperformed the rest of the credit market following the fuss made around the damages that the US department of Justice could impose on some European banks in their case regarding the misselling of asset backed securities. 
  Today the trend was fuelled on the one hand by UK retailers – most of which are included in iTraxx Main - which saw their risk risk premia driven wider after PM May declared over the week-end that article 50 should be triggered by the end of March 2017 and increased the odds of a “hard” Brexit leading to renewed Sterling weakness. On the other hand, CONVAT (ConvaTec Healthcare E S.A.), which is included in iTraxx Crossover, was 119bps tighter after the company said it plans to raise $1.8Bln in London’s biggest initial public offering this year.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market was fairly dull today and indices traded sideways as investors were digesting the late day rally which took place on Friday.

"
"Tapered Before It Ends?. Despite the return of German investors after a day’s holiday, until the very end, the credit market was experiencing a very quiet session. We had to wait until the last hour of trading to get a bit of excitement, when headlines appeared announcing that the ECB would be considering gradually winding down bond purchases before the conclusion of quantitative easing. The current date of the program’s end is less than six months away - March 2017 -, and an informal consensus among policy makers would have emerged to taper asset purchases by €10Bln a month. Even though this risk had been flagged by some analysts, investors were probably underestimating it ahead of the ECB meetings in October (20th) and December (8th). The news led to a late blip in European credit indices, particularly iTraxx Main (ITXEB) which jumped 2bps to 75bps, while it had spent the whole session in a narrow 73bps/74bps range. After the recent weakness in the European financial sector, that was enough to close the gap between ITXEB and CDXIG, its US equivalent. While CDXIG was trading 7bps wider than ITXEB a couple of weeks ago, just after the roll, they are now trading at the same level.
"
"Backed By Volumes. Because of the sheer size of their outstanding debt and their importance as trading counterparties, the financial sector has always been the most actively traded, after sovereigns, as far as Credit Default Swaps (CDS) are concerned. Since the beginning of the year, traded volumes on CDS of financial institutions represent 40% of the total of CDS traded on European corporate entities. That percentage has been fairly stable, even since mid-September when the whole DB’s ( Deutsche Bank AG ) angst started. What has not been stable though is the share of that volume represented by trades on DB’s CDS. It has exploded. While during that period, volumes traded on DB’s stock have roughly doubled, the notional of CDS has increased 10 folds. More than $500mln worth of 5-year CDS were exchanged every single day of last week. If the 5-year risk premium has come down compared with its peak a couple of weeks ago, these volumes tell you that risk managers are taking the damage to DB’s financial health which a jumbo fine would cause very seriously.
"
"The Rise And Fall Of Dispersion. Since the beginning of the year, there has been a significant rebound in commodity prices, and particularly in oil. From a low of $35 per barrel in January, WTI is now trading at $50 and has been trading above $45 – bar a fortnight spell at the end of July – since mid-April. Unsurprisingly, the risk premia of energy related names have benefitted from this rebound in prices. Over the last 6 months, the average 5-year risk premium of the names that compose the energy subset of CDXIG has tightened by more than 120bps to roughly 160bps. While people were scrambling to buy protection on these names earlier in the year, the situation has normalised to a large extent. If energy is still the widest sector in CDXIG, it has been brought back in check and the imbalance between buyers and sellers has largely disappeared. The dispersion among constituents of CDXIG have decreased and so has the basis (difference between the quoted value of an index and the theoretical value computed using the individual prices of its constituents) of CDXIG. From highly stressed levels in April - CDXIG26 was almost 75cts expensive compared to its fair value -, the basis of CDXIG26 is now worth less than 10cts, not even enough to lure arbitrageurs into trying to capture it.
"
"The Fall And Fall Of Sterling. When European investors arrived in the office this morning, news of the British Pound flash crash was all over their screen. As the session wore on though, the move against other major currencies persisted, showing it might be more than just computers racing against each other to drive down the price of the UK currency. Mrs May signalled that a crackdown on immigration took precedence over membership of the Eurozone market. This was met with a hardening of European leaders’ position, and it dawned on traders that the UK economy could be harder hit than they previously thought. These concerns translated into new lows for the pound, but they also affected UK retailers. Their share price were marked down and their 5 year risk premia were pushed wider, making them the worst performing group during today’s session.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market, which initially showed signs of weakness, closed almost unchanged across the board. Credit indices are finding it very difficult to sustain any protracted widening at the moment.

"
"Not Out Of The Wood Yet. Since MTNLN (Matalan) was introduced in the iTraxx Crossover index, it has not been a walk in the park for the faithful investors who remained committed to the company’s debt. There have been many ups and downs... mainly downs. Hence the results the company published today came as a relief. In the quarter which ended August 2016, MTNLN reported EBITDA that came ahead of analysts’ expectations and gross profit recovered strongly from a year before (from a low base though, as the reference period saw the biggest decline in profits due to distribution centre issues). MTNLN’s bonds first rose as much as 3pts, before settling around 2pts higher on the day following a slightly less constructive management call. CDS on its side held to its gains and closed 3.5pts lower at 35pts upfront plus 500bps running.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market proved resilient. In the absence of the US and without any macro news to push them meaningfully one way or the other, gravity progressively took hold and after an unchanged open, European credit indices closed a tad tighter across the board.

"
"The Earning Circus Is Back In Town. We already had a trickle of results in the past few weeks, but the reporting season begun in earnest today. Over the next few weeks, all major companies will be releasing third numbers on both sides of the Atlantic. As is now customary, AA ( Alcoa Inc ) kicked off the proceedings, and they did it in style. The 128-year-old company reported their last earnings before splitting into two entities - the newly branded Arconic which will service aerospace and automotive industries, and the new Alcoa which will focus on their mining and smelting operations in bauxite, alumina and aluminium products – and missed both earnings (32cts/share vs 34cts expected) and revenue (total sales fell to $5.2Bln vs $5.33Bln expected) estimates. More importantly, they lowered Q4 and year-end guidance, adding that next year’s outlook was “very hard” to read. Investors punished the stock and marked it 10% lower, while they sent AA’s 5-year risk premium 17.5bps wider at 250bps, still a long way away from the 650bps it reached at the very beginning of the year though.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market was on the back foot. Credit indices suffered as US equities felt the brunt of a strong dollar and the disappointing start to the earning season. In Europe iTraxx Main and iTraxx Crossover closed 1bp and 4.5bps  wider at 74.5bps and 335bps respectively, while, in the US, CDXIG was 1bp wider at 75bps and CDXHY 2bps wider at 404bps.

"
"Long Live The King. Markets do not usually follow every footsteps of royals, but today there was a marked interest for the world’s longest reigning monarch, King Bhumibol. The king of Thailand’s reign begun more than 70 years ago, and he is seen by many as a unifying presence in a country which has seen 19 coups (or attempted coups) since 1932. Since the royal palace announced on Sunday that the 88-year monarch’s health was unstable, the Thai currency has fallen every session and the 5-year risk premium of the kingdom of Thailand has risen every day. The latter has been pushed 17bps wider to 100bps. The increased probability of rate hike in the US was certainly a contributing factor to this poor performance, but fears about political stability in the country appear to have been the main driver.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market struggled to find a direction, ahead of the release of the minutes of the last FOMC tonight. Credit indices stayed in very narrow ranges throughout the session and closed unchanged on the day.

"
"Marmitegate. Fears that the uninterrupted fall in the british pound will lead to price increases in some products got more real yesterday as the “marmitegate” came to light. TSCOLN ( Tesco Plc) and UNANA ( Unilever Plc) are locking horns over who shall bear the burden, as many of UNANA’s products have become more costly to the British buyers. It will be shared between UNANA and its suppliers on the one hand, and TSCOLN and the end customers on the other hand. But the grocer feels it and its customers are being asked to shoulder to much of the pain. TSCOLN is resisting UNANA’s attempt to lift prices, and the dispute has promptly led to a disruption of the supply of some popular brands to the supermarket chain, making  Marmite and Pot Noodle a rare sight on TSCOLN’s shelves. Investors have been wary of such situations. Consequently, they have marked UK retailers’ risk premia wider across the board, since UK and European leaders have adopted a harder stance regarding Brexit.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market is still finding it difficult to go wider. Once again credit indices ended hardly changed on the day, and implied volatility of credit options is going down as a result.

"
"A Dire Quarter. LMETEL ( Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson) is usually a well-behaved credit. Its 5-year risk premium is highly correlated with the risk premium of iTraxx Main (ITXEB), the European investment grade benchmark. It has been a very different story since the beginning of the week though. While ITXEB ended where it begun at 74bps, LMETEL experienced a brutal 5-day trading period. On Wednesday, the Swedish phone-network maker warned on its Q3 results. It reported plunging third quarter sales (down 14%) and earnings, deepening a crisis at a company already slashing jobs (3000 job cuts were announced last week) to cope with slumping demand and intensifying competition. On that day, its stock plummeted 20%. To add to investors’ misery, Moody’s reduced today its credit rating by 1 notch to Baa2, adding that it may be lowered further. LMETEL’s 5-year risk premium, which was already 20bps wider since the beginning of week, increased a further 7bps to 113bps, making it one of the poorest performers of ITXEB.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market concluded a fairly quiet week in a fairly quiet way. Credit indices have experienced minimal variations once again. On the week, iTraxx Main is flat at 74bps, iTraxx Crossover is 1bp tighter at 333bps and CDXIG is 1bp wider at 76bps.

"
"Bets Are Off. It was made public this morning that 18 employees of CWNAU ( Crown Resorts Ltd ) are detained by the Chinese authorities in a high profile crackdown on casino operators. The government in Beijing is focusing again on foreign companies which have marketing operations in China and try to woo its citizens to gamble overseas. More than a third of CWNAU’s revenue at its Australian resorts comes from international visitors, predominantly mainland China, and the firm is building a high roller casino resort at Barangaroo on Sydney’s waterfront. The arrests triggered a steep fall of the shares of casino companies operating in the region. Even though analysts were assuming it should not have significant impact on the credit profile of CWLAU, when they saw its shares plunging almost 14%, credit investors marked the 5-year CDS 18bps wider at 210bps.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market spent another dull session trading sideways. All credit indices remained in very tight ranges and the only noticeable fact was the outperformance of iTraxx Main which closed 0.5bps tighter at 73.5bps, while all other indices ended the day a tad wider.


"
"Action At Last... In Italy. Italian banks have been much talked about over the last few sessions. Positive vibes first came during the week-end when Banca Popolare Di Milano and BPIM ( Banca Popolare SC ) won shareholders’ approval for a merger creating Italy’s third largest lender. Today, MONTE’s ( Banca Monte dei Paschi  ) board met after asking their CEO to look into a proposal by Mr Passera, Italy’s ex-minister for economic development and former CEO of Intesa Sanpaolo, to shore up its finances. The plan envisions a €5Bln capital increase, which would include a €1Bln share sale to existing shareholders and €2.5Bln from new long terms backers. While volumes traded on peripheral banks are still dwarfed by transactions on DB, these string of positive news enabled them to outperformed their peers recently and they are the brightest green spots in the above grapple.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market also benefitted from the better tone in the financial sector and from a few earnings beats which buoyed the equity market. Until tomorrow night, iTraxx Main and CDXIG could find it difficult to trade significantly away from their current levels (72.5bps and 75bps respectively) as these are important pins for options expiring late in the afternoon.

"
"Volatility Is Dead. Today was option expiry, so it is only fair that we talk a little about volatility. Since the beginning of the Corporate Sector Purchase Programme (CSPP) announcement in March, and even more since its effective start in June 2016, risk premia in Europe - but also in the US - have experienced extremely low volatility, barring a short spell before and right after the UK referendum which eventually led to Brexit. The 20-day historical volatility of iTraxx Main (ITXEB) stands at 23%, which is its lowest level over the last 3 years. Daily moves have been minimal, and if you correct the time series of ITXEB - respectively CDXIG - from the roll effect on September 20th, it has stayed in a 65bps/71bps - respectively 68bps/76bps - range since the 12th July. It is no wonder then that options implied volatility has come crashing down. At the money 1-month implied volatility is trading at 35%, while it was worth 45% at the end of September. As risk premia are at the tights of the year, it means that it has never been cheaper to protect your portfolio against an unexpected blip in the market before year-end.
 

"
"What About Rallye’s Rally?. Yesterday, RALFP ( Rallye SA ) launched a new €200mln convertible bond. It was not your typical CB, as the company announced a non-dilutive cash-settled bonds exchangeable into COFP ( Casino Guichard Perrachon SA ) shares. The deal was priced on the most favourable terms to investors initially indicated, but the fact that it was successfully launched is a good example of the bullish sentiment in the lower reaches of the credit barrel. Once the deal appeared to be done, RALFP’s 5-year CDS went 1.5pts tighter (it is currently trading in upfront format plus a 500bps coupon). The 5-year risk premium of RALFP was effectively indicated 64bps tighter at the close. But this innovative structure raised a few eyebrows and refreshed the divided opinions on the name. The tightening came to a halt today and the bullish momentum was lost during the session as buyers of protection emerged at these tighter levels.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market had a solid session. Credit indices confirmed yesterday’s gains and closed tighter across the board, particularly iTraxx Crossover which closed 4bps tighter at 319bps. Indeed, during his press conference, Mr Draghi said nothing to discourage investors from taking more risk.

"
"Cough Up A bit More Please. This morning, BATSLN ( British American Tobacco Plc ) offered to merge with RAI ( Reynolds American, Inc. ). BATSLN already owns 42% of RAI, and the offer targets the remaining 58%. Over the past few years, several failed attempts were made to take full ownership with a view to create a geographically diverse group, since RAI is focused on the US and BATSLN is weighted towards everywhere else. There would also be scope for scale economies in R&D; for smokeless technologies, justifying the high multiples of the transaction – 16.3 times 12-month trailing Ebitda -. The current proposal values RAI at $56.5/share – that is a 20% premium to yesterday’s close – of which $24.13 will be cash, but discussions have not begun between the two companies and RAI was said to want a higher premium. In any case, the total cash contribution should be in excess of $20Bln and investors are expecting a heavy bond issuance to finance the deal which will increase leverage by roughly one time. They send BATSLN’s 5-year risk premium 7bps wider at 65bps without waiting for the final details of the operation.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market was quiet, and traded volumes on credit indices stood 30 to 40% below average. While risk premia were a touch wider across the board, moves were kept minimal.

"
"The Cost Of Care. GNW ( Genworth Financial Inc ) offers insurance, wealth management, investment and financial solutions. It products covers mortgage guaranty, life insurance and long-term care insurance. It operates in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico and some European countries. Recently, the company had been selling assets to ensure it had sufficient liquidity after it was hit by losses on its long term care (LTC) coverage, which pays for home health aides and nursing home stays. The challenges facing the LTC unit were probably behind the decision of GNW to agree to sell itself to China Oceanwide for $2.7Bln, and they are also the reason why GNW is unlikely to receive a higher offer despite the small premium offered ($5.43 per share vs a closing price of $5.21 on Friday) to equity investors. But the Chinese company also promised to provide $600mln to GNW to address debt maturing in 2018, which was fast becoming a major hurdle for GNW in its current form. Credit investors breathed a major sigh of relief, and sent GNW’s 5-year risk premium 78bps tighter to 578bps.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market took comfort from the positive tone in equities after a decent start to the reporting season and from the resolution of the political impasse in Spain which will enable Mr Rajoy to eventually serve a second term. iTraxx Main and CDXIG were 1bp tighter at 70bps and 74bps respectively, while iTraxx Crossover and CDXHY were 4bps tighter at 316bps and 397bps respectively.

"
"Too Many Balls In The Air?. Over the last fortnight, MONTE’s ( Banca Monte dei Paschi  ) stock has roughly doubled. The 5-year risk premium of its senior debt has been cut by 125bps to 350bps since late September. This morning, it looked as if this amazing ride could continue for a while. The company outlined plans to eliminate 2,600 jobs, shut 500 branches and slash the lender's €28Bln pile of bad loans. That sent the stock another 20% up and the debt risk premium another 20bps tighter. To complete its turnaround, the bank also needs to raise €5Bln in fresh capital by year end though, and the CEO admitted that his effort had only begun in that respect. The plan involves a voluntary debt to equity swap, in order to cut the amount MONTE would need to raise from shareholders. The bank wants to spin off €28Bln of souring loan, swap debt for equity and manage a capital increase all at the same time in an exceptionally compressed timeframe. To make things trickier still, there is the December 4 constitutional referendum in Italy which could lead to a increased volatility towards the end of the year. When that reality hit investors, they sent the stock 30% down from its - 15% down on the day  -and the risk premium back to almost unchanged on the day.

"It Is A Good Time To Be An Investment Banker. They cannot stop… Every day brings news of new M&A; deals going through or in the making. They take place in all geographies and impact companies of all sizes. After mega deals announced in the media and telecommunication industry and in the tobacco sector, shipping provided the market with some excitement today. CMACG (CMA CMG), the French private company which bought Neptune Orient Lines Ltd earlier this year for $2.4Bln – the deal was completed in June and Neptune Orient Lines delisted in September -, announced that they have started the process of selling the Singapore company’s terminal business in a move that could net them roughly $1bln. CMA CMG was introduced in the iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) index for the first time in March this year and it was one of the new entrants in the series 25. Since then, its 5-year risk premium has had a chaotic run as investors’ nerves have been tested by a few defaults in the industry along the way. The sale which may attract interest from terminal and ship operators as well as infrastructure funds will help CMACG cut its debt pile which currently stands at roughly $2.2Bln. This rare piece of good news was enough for investors to send CMACG 5-year risk premium 4.625 points tighter (that is almost 200bps running) to 21pts upfront + 500bps running (ie insuring $1 of CMACG’s debt against default for 5 years costs 21cts upfront and another 5cts every year).

Meanwhile, the broader credit market tried to trade wider during most of the session as interest rates have resumed their trend higher, but without any real conviction. Eventually a spike in oil prices on the back of some inventory data was used as an excuse to bring credit indices to almost unchanged levels on the day across the board. 

"
"Yes… But No. When they reported third quarter earnings this morning, DB ( Deutsche Bank AG ) beat on every line. Net income was €256Mln after a loss of €6.01Bln a year ago and against an average estimate by analysts of a €390Mln loss. CIB revenues were up 10% at €1.96Bln against a €1.86Bln estimate. Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.1% against a 10.9% estimate. Risk Weighted Assets were down 2% (less €18Bln at €385Bln). That initially gave DB’s 5-year risk premium a boost and its 5-year CDS referencing its senior debt was down 15bps at 207bps. But soon, questions begun to be asked. As good as they are, results still lag US peers. Asset Management revenues were up 30% at €823Mln, but DB has seen outflows and a drop in volumes in this division. On litigation, the CEO did not give any update this morning, merely saying that the bank is “working hard on achieving a resolution” with US authorities as part of a push to resolve all major litigation issues this fiscal year. So much so that at the end of the day, DB’s risk premium closed unchanged.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market first benefitted from the publication of the results of a few banks (Barclay’s, BBVA, DNB joined DB in reporting good numbers this morning) but the continued rise in interest rates (US 10 years +6bps at 1.85% and German 10 years +9bps at 0.17%) eventually dragged it wider. iTraxx Main and CDXIG were 1bp wider at 723bps and 76bps respectively, while iTraxx Crossover and CDXHY were 5bps and 6bps wider at 326bps and 409bps respectively.

"
"The Biggest Outflow Ever. Volumes were healthy today, but despite more banks beating expectations when they released their results this morning, credit indices were weak from the word “go”. There was no protection buying tidal wave, but indices traded heavily, particularly iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX). On top of interest rates staying at the high end of their recent range, people pointed to a massive outflow in High Yield ETFs in the US as a possible explanation. 11.5mln shares were redeemed yesterday. That is nearly $1Bln and over 5% of the fund. That was the largest ever redemption to take place in a day. At the moment, investors mainly expressed their caution through indices and fair values have been very stable over the last few sessions. That was enough to push ITXEX basis (the difference between its quoted risk premium and the theoretical risk premium computed using the risk premia of its constituents) back into positive territory. Over the last week, while its theoretical value was 4bps wider, ITXEX widened by 9bps to 329bps. The basis of ITXEX now stands at 10cts. That is hardly enough to entice arbitragers to try and get advantage of it, but they are certainly getting ready.

"Three Become One. MITSOL ( Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd ), KAWKIS ( Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd ), and NIPYU ( Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha ) plan to merge their container businesses to create a company that will control 7 percent of the box-shipping trade. The idea is to take some competitive pressure off the 3 companies by rationalizing their overlapping shipping routes. NIPYU‘s liner trade business made a pretax loss for the three past quarters. KAWKIS’s container-ship operations have made a pretax loss for the past five quarters, while MITSOL’s have made a pretax loss for the last 20 quarters. The environment for this sector is not good, and the filing for bankruptcy protection of Hanjin Shipping over the summer only served as a stern reminder of the extreme difficulties the industry is experiencing to recover from the slump that has plagued it since the global financial crisis. Most analysts reckon it is better to do something than not do anything, and getting bigger could be a way to improve the outlook according to NIPYU’s president. Investors cheered the move and sent NIPYU’s 5-year risk premium 8bps tighter at 69bps, MITSOL’s 20bps tighter at 125bps and KAWKIS’s 15.5bps tighter at 147.5bps. With all 3 names in iTraxx Japan Series 26, they explained 100% of today’s index tightening.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market was understandably quiet as part of Europe will be out tomorrow. Variations were contained, but credit felt a bit weak, and more so in the US than in Europe.

"
"Is It Worth Anything?. Some of the market focus was back on financials over the last few sessions. But for once, it was not the result of some US Department of Justice fine related headline. The talks centered around UK banks and effectiveness going forward of CDS referencing OpCo senior debt to protect investors in case of bail in. The UK regulator has articulated “Single Point of Entry” as the preferred resolution strategy. Under this approach, the loss absorbing capacity has to be concentrated at the resolution entity, which in this case is the HoldCo. Indeed, especially for large systemically important banks, there is a huge volume of “excluded liabilities” (deposits, derivatives portfolios, …) which rank pari passu with the senior debt of OpCo entities, therefore giving rise to high litigation risk and removing the required legal certainty for the resolution action undertaken. That is also the reason why UK banks are required to issue HoldCo senior debt to meet their TLAC obligations. Hence the point of some analysts who argue that buying protection on OpCo UK banks senior debt is next to useless on the basis that any government intervention would be focused on the HoldCo senior debt.
"
"Shall Polls Be Trusted?. By this time next week we may know who the next president of the United States of America is going to be, but right now the outcome of the vote is far from certain, contrary to what most people thought only a week ago. Democratic contender Hillary Clinton has seen her odds of a victory falter after the FBI reopened a probe into an e-mail server, and election blues has hit the market as an ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll published yesterday showed Donald Trump ahead for the first time since May. 1% currently separates the 2 candidates, which is well within the survey’s 3% margin of sample error though. But as recently as this week-end, Mrs Clinton was having a similar lead, and it is this seemingly swing in momentum which is unsettling investors. They fear Trump’s victory could lead to more volatility and flight to safety, and they take chips off the table heading into next week. From its tightest level (74bps) reached on the 24th October, CDXIG Series 27 has widened 7 sessions in a row to 80.5bps at the end of the European session today and is closing fast on its widest level (81bps) reached on the 21st September. 


"
"Judgement Day. Even though the reporting season is still in full swing, earnings have taken a back seat over the last few sessions. At the moment, macro considerations are definitely driving the price action. The US election has been front and center since Friday, and the most recent developments in the presidential race have unsettled markets and threatened to push credit indices out of the range in which they have been confined since early July. Today, in the UK, the High Court ruled that a vote must be held in Parliament before starting the two-year countdown to Brexit. It is difficult to imagine the MPs voting against the mandate of the people, as voting against Brexit would certainly trigger a significant backlash from the public. Therefore, the decision will certainly not reverse the intention of the UK to trigger article 50 and exit the EU, but it certainly represents a setback for Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan to unilaterally start the process. The perception is that the result will force a softer Brexit plan with the more pro-European Parliament shaping the negotiations, rather than the hard Brexit bias that has been coming from the ruling Conservative party over the last month. Investors swiftly factored that in and after an initial heavy open, they sent credit indices tighter across the board, back into their narrow trading range.

"OPEC’s Shenanigans. The US presidential election is still currently the overriding theme in financial markets. Tension in that respect eased somewhat today as a few polls showed Mrs Clinton nudging back ahead of Mr Trump after a difficult week. That said, the market was distracted from the election risk reassessment by oil, which grabbed a few headlines after it reached a 5-week low. Domestic crude oil stockpiles surged by a record 14.4 million barrels in the week ending 28th October according to the US Energy Information Agency in a report they published yesterday. Hopes are fading fast that OPEC will be able to implement the tentative deal reached earlier in the year in Algiers to cut production and ease global oversupplies. As a result, WTI lost another 2% today, confirming Thursday’s close below $45. It is now down 15% over the last couple of weeks and its price action weighted on the energy sector, which was the underperformer of the session. It was particularly obvious among the CDXHY constituents, as shown by the above grapple. 
"
"Time To Buy Gamma?. It was a strong start to the week as we learned over the week-end that FBI Director James Comey decided that Mrs Clinton should not face criminal charges related to use of a personal e-mail server while she was secretary of state. It put an end to the review of newly discovered e-mails announced 10 days ago which breathed new life into Trump’s candidacy. The odds of a Clinton’s victory now stand at 83% with bookmakers. The impact on markets is positive as they reckon this scenario would bring less uncertainty than Mr Trump becoming president. It also led to an outperformance of US credit indices compared to their European equivalents. iTraxx Main and Crossover closed 2bps and 12bps tighter at 74bps and 326bps respectively, while CDXIG and CDXHY closed 3bps and 17bps at 77bps and 414bps. There is still some way to go before credit is back to the tightest levels of the year though, as some big hedge funds are reported to maintain some hedges in place until the final results are known. Depending on the outcome, there is still some room for a move one way or the other.

"Hertz's Car Crash. The business of car rental is not only about your ability to maintain a high utilisation rate of your fleet. It is also about selling the cars you do not want to offer to your customers, and depreciation is actually the highest cost in the industry. In a September conference, HTZ’s ( Hertz Global Holdings, Inccn ) management said that they were comfortable with the residual value estimates of their cars for the year. So yesterday night, when the company reported third quarter profit that badly trailed analysts’ estimates, blaming a decline in revenue and a drop in the values of its cars, it came as a shock to investors. The company reduced its full year earnings outlook to 51cts to 88cts, after saying a couple of months ago it expected $2.75 to $3.50. It now forecast Ebitda of $575mln to $625mln which may push leverage to more than 5 times at the end of the year, a level Moody’s said earlier could pressure HTZ’s rating. This dent into the management’s forecasting abilities led to the worst ever trading session for the stock (which was down 52% at some stage and 34% at the European close) and a brutal repricing of HTZ’s 5-year risk premium, which closed 151bps wider at 654bps.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market was in wait and see mode ahead of the result of the US election tonight. Protection felt bid for choice throughout the session until the close when early forecaster reports said Clinton would be ahead in Florida, Iowa, Nevada, Ohio and Colorado triggering a late day tightening.

"
"What Happened??. “What happened?” is the question many people were asking themselves in Europe when they woke up and see that one of the most controversial character in US politics was announced president elect. Donald Trump won comfortably the presidential election and will become the 45th president of the US. The first market reaction was one of caution as there are many unknowns regarding policies that will be conducted going forward. All risky assets tanked, among them credit. iTraxx Main and CDX IG opened 8bps wider at 81bps and 85bps, while iTraxx Crossover opened 35bps wider at 360bps. But rapidly profit takers emerged and begun to sell protection. From these early wides, the whole session turned out to be a consistent grind tighter, bar a spell of stability for a couple of hours before the US came in. The amount of hedges that had to be unwound was unexpected. Volumes traded on every single index were roughly twice their daily average, and, at the end of the day, all credit indices were unchanged compared with yesterday’s close. The same was true for most risky assets - after an incredibly volatile day though -, except interest rates. The US 10 year interest rate closed 20bps higher at 2.05%. So far, any rise in rates has triggered a widening in credit risk premia. If there was no election and 10 year ramped to 2.05%, would we have had that kind of rally? People were left wondering “what happened??”.
"
"The Day After. As the markets emerged from the initial shock of a Trump win, the realities of what could be ""Trumpenomics"", namely a spike in government spending, a row-back on banking regulation, wholesale tax cuts, (even) less attention paid to environment issues and a country less open to the outside world started to sink in. After an initial continuation of yesterday’s aggressive rally that took us back to the tightest levels of the most recent series of indices – a dealer put it nicely saying he was seeing some very good one-way flow – in the morning, important dispersion among sectors started to appear. Metals & Miners were the most active and outperformed the rest of the market by a fair margin on both sides of the Atlantic, with core banks also in vogue. At the other end of the performance spectrum, emerging markets got hammered and the CDX EM series 26 widened more than 25bps in high volumes, with close to $3bln of index changing hands. 
 
"
"Will There Be Blood?. Even though daily variations had been contained so far this week, intraday volatility has been huge in most risky assets since the surprise results of the US presidential election. After a demanding week, investors who came into the office this morning were expecting a fairly quiet session, as US fixed income markets were having a day off for Veterans Day. It was not really how it panned out though. After a weak overnight session in Asia, they were greeted by a spike in European interest rates, with the German 10Y rate reaching 0.345%, a whopping 7bps higher. Once the Bund settled – still roughly 3bps higher on the day -, it became a periphery and emerging markets story, with sovereigns taking another leg wider after yesterday’s already dismal performance. Italian BTPs are hitting year to date wides against Bunds - north of 200bps -, and both Spanish and French government are decompressing to Bunds as well. That contributed to a weak and volatile session in credit markets. iTraxx Main went from 75bps to 78.5bps by mid-morning, then traded back to 76bps at lunchtime, only to drift again in the afternoon when it reached 79bps. It eventually closed a tad off that level at 78bps, 3bps wider on the day. All eyes will be on the US on Monday, as people will want to know if there will be some follow through in the surge of interest rates. If they remain of their recent trajectory, there will be blood.
"
"An Arbitragers’ Fest. Credit and stocks were on 2 very different trajectories today. Equities have outperformed bonds since Donald Trump was announced as the 45th president of the United States, on speculation his pledge to spend more on infrastructure will trigger interest rate hikes amid a pick-up in growth and inflation. We had more of the same in the morning, and while stocks were up more than 1%, credit indices were under big pressure from buyers of protection eager to protect portfolios of bonds - particularly iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) – who prevented them from tightening and even pushed them wider. At the same time some specific news pushed a few individual credits tighter, and in certain cases much tighter. For instance, Intrum Justitia, the Swedish debt collecting company, announced they are buying Lindorff AB, one of their Norwegian competitor. In the process, Lindorff’s debt will be refinanced and CDS referencing LINDOR (Lock Lower Holding AS), the issuer of their current debt, will most likely become orphaned. It triggered an almost 450bps tightening of LINDOR’s. It pushed the basis of ITXEX into positive territory, and arbitragers rushed to unwind some of the positions which were accumulated over the last 12 months during which indices have traded chronically rich to their fair values.
"
"Italian Risk Reversal. MONTE ( Banca Monte dei Paschi  ) gave some details about their debt for equity exchange yesterday night. They plan to offer equity worth between 85% and 100% of face value to the holders of their €4.3Bln outstanding subordinated bonds. The generous terms reflect the need to deliver on this transaction as fully as possible. Indeed, they want to keep the amount of fresh external equity to be raised to a minimum, as the €5Bln total capital increase planned before the end of the year is instrumental in a process that should lead to the deconsolidation of their almost €28Bln portfolio of non-performing loans. Renewed confidence in the success of the deal led investors to send MONTE’s 5-year risk premium 12bps tighter to 392bps, and benefitted the whole Italian complex which outperformed other members of the European financial sector.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market benefitted from the stabilisation of interest rates in Europe and in the US which held onto their overnight (modest) gains throughout the session. iTraxx Crossover and CDX High Yield were the outperformers (closing 9bps and 16bps tighter at 341bps and 418bps respectively), while iTraxx Main (ITXEB) and CDX IG closed 1.5bps and 3bps tighter at 77.5bps and 75bps respectively. Tomorrow is option expiry day on credit indices, and chances are that ITXEB will be attracted by the 75bps strike which represents an important option pin.

"
"It Was Not Trump. On the 9th November HEIGR’s ( HeidelbergCement AG  ) 5-year risk premium had one its best day of the last 6 months. On that day, the company reported its third quarter results and, despite a miss, reassured somewhat investors when it confirmed guidance for the full year. It was not the reason behind the tightening of its 5-year CDS though. Neither was it due to the shock results of the US elections which catapulted to power Mr Trump and his $500Bln construction goal. On that day, HEIGR was assigned an investment grade rating by S&P.; Investors did not spend too much time reading the rationale of the upgrade. They merely factored in the price of its debt the fact that going forward it would be eligible to the ECB Corporate Sector Purchase Program. The presence of that newfound buyer made all the difference. 
"
"Who Is On Top?. Since the election of Mr Trump a week ago, some risky assets have experienced some severe repricing. Most notably, interest rates have been pushed much higher, triggering some weakness in the corporate cash market. In a unexpected twist, some of the names which had benefitted the most from the ECB Corporate Sector Purchase Program and were trading at tighter spreads than their respective sovereign have been the most affected. Peripheral utilities are among the biggest casualties of the recent corporate bonds sell off and it has eventually fed through the CDS market. Peripheral financials have also fared pretty badly during that period. At the same time, the US energy and consumer cyclical sectors have been the big outperformers, as they are expected to make the most of a pick-up in growth which could result from some of Mr Trump announced economic measures. So much so that the relationship between iTraxx Main (ITXEB) and CDX IG has inverted. While ITXEB was trading 5bps inside CDX IG at the beginning of the month (75bps vs 80bps), ITXEB is now trading 5bps wider.
"
"The Week That Was. The market direction in Bunds has been comparatively stable recently, but the movement in periphery yields have remained especially volatile, at levels not seen since the aftermath of the Brexit vote. BTPs – Italian Treasury Bonds – have remained at the epicentre in terms of relative moves in both directions over the past week, though mainly to the downside. The clear reason for this is the increasing proximity to the Italian referendum on constitutional reforms, which will be held on December 4th. Today was no exception, and an early widening in BTPs and OATs – French government bonds – led to further underperformance of peripheral credits. The valuation-based sell-off of corporate cash continued given that the entire investment grade corporate market trades insides treasury yield. Tight corporate cash was particularly affected, dragging associated CDS wider. Today and for most of the week, flows from investors were focused on better buying of protection.
"
"Thanksgiving Lull. Thanksgiving is 3 days away, and this week will effectively be a 3-day week. So no-one really expected a bumper session in terms of trading and the fact that the week-end brought an array of “positive” political headline did nothing to upset that view. In Germany, incumbent Chancellor Angela Merkel announced she will be running a fourth term in the election next year. This should not have come as a major surprise, but having the confirmation is always useful. Meanwhile in France, the first round of voting for Les Républicains’ (French moderate right wing party) candidate in next year’s presidential election was held. François Fillon was the surprise front-runner, with 44% of the votes, followed by Alain Juppé (28%) and Nicolas Sarkozy (21%). The second round will take place next Sunday between Fillon and Juppé. From a market perspective, both candidates stand a better chance of beating far right leader Marine Le Pen than Sarkozy – it is widely expected the Les Républicains candidate will face off against Le Pen in the second of the presidential election – and should be able to establish a stable majority in the lower house. If you add a stabilisation in interest rates, it is easy to understand why credit indices traded in extremely tight ranges (81-82 for iTraxx Main; 75-76 for CDXIG; 343-348 for iTraxx Crossover) at slightly tighter levels than Friday, in volumes that were roughly 25% lower than their 20-day average.
"
"If You Blinked You Missed It. “We have been hacked” said the spokesman of VINCI ( Vinci SA  ), denying that the company had released any statement earlier in the afternoon. At 4.20pm, he said that VINCI had been the victim of defamatory statement and that the release claiming the French builder had fired its finance chief amid irregularities was a hoax. Nevertheless, 10 minutes earlier when news that VINCI had discovered accounting errors hit the wire, some did not think twice and pressed the sell button. The stock plunged 18%, wiping more than €6bln of market capitalisation, before recovering most of the loss after the report was confirmed to be false. While the stock experienced its most extraordinary 15-minute trading spell, credit investors hardly had time to react and VINCI’s 5-year risk premium was stable all day long, a couple of bps tighter than yesterday’s close at 58bps. While volume exchanged on the stock was 4 times the daily average since the beginning of the year, nothing out of the ordinary was reported on CDS. The French market authority has launched an enquiry, and that unheard of type hoax will probably give many foods for thought in the coming days.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market went through another quiet session and, in a similar fashion to yesterday, both ranges and daily variations were minimal for all indices. If anything, iTraxx Financial Senior slightly outperformed the rest of the market as relative value trades were unwound.

"
"Pricing The Worst For Once?. The US never really showed up today, and, in Europe, players felt reluctant to go long risk before Thanksgiving into the liquidity vacuum which is expected until Monday. There was therefore little resistance when iTraxx Main (ITXEB) went from 79bps to 82bps. The referendum on constitutional reforms in Italy is drawing ever closer – it will be held on December 4th – and this time polls are forecasting an upset that would see the “No” coming on top. If they are correct, the deputy-secretary of Mr Renzi’s Democratic Party confirmed that they would seek early elections by the summer 2017, without saying whether Mr Renzi would stay on to lead the party. That certainly contributed to the weakness in peripheral names, particularly the banking sector which was not helped by a story run in the Italian press that the ECB has found BPIM’s loan book to be under covered with regard to certain exposures to the tune of 1 to 2 billion euros. It made ITXEB the underperformer of the day once again, as it looks stuck at the top of its recent range. The gap between ITXEB and its US equivalent, CDX Investment Grade, is the widest we have seen since Brexit. It stands at 8bps, with CDXIG closing at 74bps.
"
"Too Defensive?. The European Central Bank warned of the risk of an abrupt market correction on the back of rising political uncertainty and the threat it could pose to banks, stability and economic growth. In their twice yearly Financial Stability Review published this morning, they said “more volatility in the near future and the potential for an abrupt reversal remains significant”. Credit investors appear to agree with that cautious stance, and iTraxx Main (ITXEB) and iTraxx Financials (ITXES) have underperformed other credit indices in the recent past and are stuck at the wides of their recent range. That caution is also apparent in the credit option market. Unlike implied volatility of other assets – equities for instance, but also CDX IG or iTraxx Crossover in credit land – ITXEB’s implied volatility has recently followed a systemic widening pattern, much like in January/February of this year. The increase has been even more pronounced on ITXES’s implied volatility mirroring the underperformance of that index. Volatility surfaces are also characterised by very steep smiles, which means that downside protection (out of the money payers) is more expensive than upside protection (out of the money receivers). So much so that investors who have a sanguine view of the market impact of the next political events and of the ECB meeting on December 8th can enter bullish strategies at attractive levels.
"
"Black Friday Keeps Investors Away. Black Friday is now a synonym for sales around the world. After days (or weeks!) of careful preparation, shoppers are flocking the streets and surfing the net to get the best bargains and make it one of the busiest day of the year in terms of retail turnover. Such was certainly not the case in credit markets today. Volumes traded were very poor on all credit indices, down more than 50% across the board compared with their daily average. In the absence of any market moving news, investors hardly felt the need to show up in the office and trading ranges were tight. If anything, a slight weakness induced by renewed pressure on interest rate and lower oil in the morning was swiftly brushed away once the US opened for their shortened trading session. With closing prices unchanged across the board, it felt very much like a day for nothing. Bargain hunters who left their office and hit the streets appeared the wiser.
"
"Mr Potato stands alone. CAG ( Conagra Brands Inc. )  was a 12BUSD revenues food US company based in Chicago. On November 9, 2016, the company completed the spin-off of Lamb Weston - essentially its frozen potato fries  business (a 4BUSD revenue business). French fries and any sort of fried potatoes is a sound investment. Half of the debt of Conagra was pushed to the new company LW (( Lamb Weston Holdings Inc. ). From a BBB- company, the new Conagra is now BBB while  Lamb Weston is a BB. According to last Friday’s ISDA determination committee, a CDS holder having 1MUSD protection on CAG is now having 500k on new CAG and 500k on LW.  New CAG is indicated 20bps tighter while LW is 40bps wider. CAG is also a member of the investment grade credit indices in the US, the CDX.IG, in all series up to the latest the series 27. All credit indices members will also be split and will have 126 reference entities, CAG and LW being half weighted. This credit event is a source of large operations for credit derivatives trade processing in the next days.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market went through a slow session with European investment grade risk being the weakest part of the investment spectrum.

"
"All Over The Place. Today was a busy session in terms of reporting in the European High Yield universe. Earnings usually have a far bigger impact on the risk premia of these names than they have on the risk premia of corporates rated investment grade. This was proven true today. If the average spread of the constituents of iTraxx Crossover was hardly changed of the day, the dispersion among them was impressive. QUIBB (Financiere Quick) reported better than expected results and during their call with analysts, the management stuck to their original plan regarding the roll out of the Burger King restaurants for 2017. That sent QUIBB’s 5-year CDS a whopping 137bps tighter at 1,278bps. At the other end of the spectrum, GALAPG (Galapagos Holding S.A.), the company which manufactures and sells heat exchangers for industrial applications, surprised the market negatively with a 37.8% decrease of order intake, flat revenues, adjusted EBITDA down 51.5% and gross margin down from 27% a year ago to 20% now. It confirmed investors’ concerns that the backlog was booked with lower profit projects. GALAPG’s 5-year risk premium was pushed 178bps wider at 1,128bps. 

Meanwhile, the broader credit market was reassured by headlines regarding the ECB willing to step in to buy Italian government bonds in case of a “NO” vote on Sunday. iTraxx Financials Senior duly outperformed the rest of the market and finished the day 3bps tighter at 106.5bps, while iTraxx Main closed 2bps tighter 80bps and iTraxx Crossover 3bps tighter at 339bps.

"
"To Fifty And Beyond. OPEC members were holding a meeting in Vienna today. They managed to confound skeptics and reached an agreement to cut oil supply, their first such move in eight years. Members of the organisation will reduce output by 1.2mln barrels per day and cap it to 32.5mln per day. With the prospect of less pumping – the agreement should come into force at the beginning of 2017 -, oil prices soared by 8%, and Brent was back above $50/barrel. After weeks of tense negotiations, the agreement, which also calls for a reduction of about 600,000 barrels a day by non-OPEC countries, was taken at face value by investors as Russia, the biggest producer outside the organisation, said it is ready to participate marking a reversal of its previous position. January is still far away and December will see ongoing record production, but that was brushed aside and the whole energy sector benefitted from the news, outperforming the rest of the market. 
"
"Is Turkey Back On The Menu?. Since the attempted coup in Turkey this summer, everything Turkish has been under pressure in financial markets. The lira has dropped almost 20% against the US dollar and it is the worst performing emerging currency, safe for the Argentine and the Mexican pesos. In November alone, the fall amounted to 10%. Turkey’s 5-year risk premium has followed a similar path and is back to its widest level of the year at 308bps, after touching 210bps in early July. During today’s session, it was pushed another 16bps wider on the back of the jump in oil price. The latter weighted on investors’ sentiment because Turkey is a net oil importer and it will increase the country’s import bill. It added to uncertainties due to a combination of weakening economic indicators and a volatile political situation following the widening crackdown after July’s failed coup. Meanwhile, the broader credit market was in wait and see mode before the all-important results of the Italian referendum on Sunday. The relief brought by higher oil prices to the energy sector was enough to offset the resumption of the interest rate upward trajectory, and credit indices were roughly unchanged across the board.
"
"As Cool As A Cucumber. The results of the referendum held in Italy on Sunday could decide whether we are about to start a new chapter in the European crisis saga. Polls suggest that Italian voters will reject the constitutional change to streamline the legislative process, a decision that could lead Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to resign. Should he quit, Italy may enter a period of political and market turmoil, possibly shaking the whole European union. It was therefore not surprising to see equity markets in what could only be described as a prudent mood, most of the European benchmarks losing roughly 0.5%. Credit markets fared much better. Credit investors appeared largely unphased by the potential upset. If anything, they felt too short risk going into the week-end, and the whole session turned into a grind tighter for European credit indices. Clients were mostly looking to trim hedges, and the risk premia of Italian banks ended up the main beneficiaries. The spread differential between iTraxx Main and CDXIG which shot up to 7bps a few days ago was back to 5bps at today’s close (78bps for iTraxx Main vs 73bps for CDXIG).
"
"Bemused. When they came into the office this morning, market makers tried to push credit indices wider on the back of the large “NO” win in the Italian referendum over the week-end. iTraxx Main (ITXEB) and iTraxx Financial Senior (ITXES) opened 3.5bps wider at 81bps and 112bps respectively. But there was no follow through whatsoever and within a couple of hours, the market was back to unchanged. Even though the pattern was quite similar to what happened post Brexit and after the US election, it left quite a few scratching their head, wondering to what extend being certain of a bad event is better than the uncertainty around it. At the end of the day, all credit indices did not follow the same path though. ITXEB closed almost unchanged at 77.5bps, iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) closed 5bps tighter at 326.5bps, but ITXES closed 2.5bps wider at 107.5bps. The resignation of Mr Renzi will certainly make the recapitalisation of Italian banks all the more complicated and their risk premia understandably moved wider. In fact, investors never expected this exercise to be a walk in the park, and the trend we witnessed today has been at play over the last few weeks. In a month, ITXEX has outperformed ITXES by roughly 45bps on a beta adjusted basis.
"
"Atomic Blow. In the wake of the Fukushima’s disaster in 2011, Mrs Merkel, who had just a few months earlier decided to extend the life of Germany’s nuclear plants, unexpectedly reversed course and announced instead that her government had opted to exit nuclear energy. After years of legal procedures, judges at the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe said in a ruling today that Germany’s shift away from atomic energy failed to tackle compensation for companies that were committed to nuclear power production, and that RWE ( RWE AG  ), EOANGR ( E.ON SE  ) and VATFAL (Vattenfall AB) should be entitled to damages. Still the court rejected the companies’ claim that the government’s 2011 decision amounted to expropriation of the utilities’ property, which means that they will get compensations ranging between €400 to €700mln according to analysts rather than the billion-euro demands they made. Even if the optimism ahead of the ECB meeting on Thursday meant that almost every single credit was indicated tighter at the end of the session today, the news gave the risk premia of RWE, EOANGR and VATFAL - which closed at 78.5bps (or 4bps tighter), 75.5bps (or 3.5bps tighter) and 53bps (or 1.5bps tighter) respectively - some extra impetus.
"
"In Mario We Trust. It was a strong day right from the start, extending the trend that emerged after the Italian referendum. Since the wides reached early on Monday, iTraxx Main (ITXEB) has tightened by 8bps (it closed at 74bps tonight), iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) by 25bps (it closed at 315.5bps tonight which is the series tights) and iTraxx Financial Senior by 13bps (it closed at 99.5bps tonight). One would have expected the move to happen after the ECB meeting which is taking place tomorrow. But even if market participants see it as the last chance for some volatility in 2016, it looks as though right now they are pricing a very benign outcome. It is also fairly obvious from the option market where implied volatility came down aggressively over the last few days. For ITXEB, options are pricing a total move of less than 5bps until the December expiry (which takes place in 2-week time), going into an important ECB meeting – during which investors expect to get some clues regarding the direction of the purchase program in 2017 - while previous ones have been the drivers of the biggest moves in credit so far this year.
"
"Is £100 Every 20 Seconds Too Much?. Six months ago, a parliamentary group began an enquiry into fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBT). In the report they published today, they recommended tighter controls on the FOBT of UK gambling companies. They made a case for cutting the stake to as low as £2 from the current £100 maximum level and slowing down the speed at which gamblers can place their bets from once every 20 seconds at present. They also suggested the number of terminals in betting shops should be reviewed. According to analysts, about half of LADLN’s ( Ladbrokes Plc  ) retail revenues come from betting machines, and about half of that comes from the type of machines under scrutiny. Even though the parliamentary group was described as “a small group of anti-FOBT MPs” who have “little credibility in terms of independence” by LADLN, investors considered the possibility of a clampdown on machines as a real threat and they sent LADLN’s 5-year risk premium 31.5bps wider at 341bps.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market traded sideways in the morning awaiting the ECB meeting. Once the decision to extend the QE program was announced, iTraxx Financial Senior and Subordinated outperformed, but variations were minimal given such an outcome for the central bank meeting had been largely priced in the market since the beginning of the week.

"
"Will They Or Won’t They?. Once the results of the Italian referendum were known, MONTE’s ( Banca Monte dei Paschi  ) board asked to the ECB an extension from the end of the year to Jan. 20 of the deadline set for its recapitalisation exercise “due to the changed reference context”. A delay would have allowed the bank more time to find investors while Italian leaders put a new government in place following the resignation of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. Early in the afternoon, it emerged that the ECB rejected the bank’s request, increasing the likelihood of a state bailout that would impose losses on shareholders and bondholders. Up to that point, the credit market had been back on the bullish trajectory it has followed since Monday. If the news was not enough to derail the whole market (iTraxx Main closed 1.5bps at 72.5bps and iTraxx Crossover 8bps tighter at 306.5bps), it reversed the trend of iTraxx Financial Senior and Subordinated which closed 1bps wider at 98bps (2bps off the intraday tights) and 3.5bps wider at 225.5bps (12bps off the intraday tights) respectively. On Monday, we might learn how systemically important MONTE really is…

"Fox Is The Hunter. On Friday, NWSA (21st Century Fox America, Inc) reached an agreement with the independent directors of BSY ( Sky Plc  ) to acquire the 60.86% of BSY it does not own at a price of £10.75. It represented a 36% premium to the price of the shares prior to the announcement (making up for part of the shares year to year drop which amounted to 37%) and valued the company at roughly £18.5Bln. While the agreement does not guarantee an offer will be made, 21st Century Fox’s CEO said their current 39% stake is “not an end state which is natural for (them)”. BSY’s stock jumped 33% when the news hit the tape, but has given some ground since and now trades 10% below the offer level. Equity investors acknowledged that if a full investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority is unlikely as pay-TV competition would not be significantly altered, there could be a regulatory review centering on media plurality and whether the deal would confer too much influence over public opinion to the Murdoch family. Credit investors took a more sanguine view, and the 5-year CDS of BSY which tightened by 20bps on Friday is still trading at the tights of the year.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market enjoyed another positive session particularly in Europe, where iTraxx Financial Senior and Subordinated (3.5bps and 9bps tighter at 94.5bps and 216.5bps respectively) once again led the charge tighter.

"
"Yes… But No… But Yes. Yesterday’s point on LINDOR’s (Lock Lower Holding AS, the holding company owning Lindorff) 5-year risk premium graph is not the result of poor data quality. On Monday morning, a representative of one the main shareholders of Intrum Justitia AB – the Swedish debt collector which should merge with its Norwegian rival – said that the terms of the deal were not good enough for them to support the transaction. All of a sudden, the odds of LINDOR being an orphan appeared to be seriously cut and its 5-year CDS jumped 112bps wider to 287bps. Overnight, the parties involved in the discussions went back to the negotiation table though and eventually decided to sweeten the terms of the 17.9-billion-krona merger for the owners of the Swedish company. The latter will receive 55% of the combined entity rather than the 53% proposed initially, enough to convince the fractious stakeholders. When the agreement was made public, LINDOR’s 5-year risk premium swiftly went back to the levels at which it was trading last week and closed at 170bps.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market benefitted from the positive tone set by the Italian banking sector on the back of UCGIM’s ( UniCredit SpA  ) capital increase. iTraxx Main closed 1.5bps tighter at 71bps, iTraxx Crossover 8bps tighter at 294 and CDX IG 1bp tighter at 67bps.

"We Remember You. CCU (iHeartCommunications, Inc) said they are not going to repay the $57.1mln of their notes maturing tomorrow that they have bought in the market earlier this year. They will repay the other $192.9mln outstanding though. The December 2016 notes are part of the “legacy notes” (together with bonds maturing in 2017 and 2018), the total outstanding amount of which decides whether the company has to provide collateral to a group of its senior creditors. If CCU can get a declaration in the Texas state court that the portion of the 2016 notes they leave unpaid counts towards the threshold - no collateral is due if the legacy notes outstanding amount is above $500mln -, they will be able to frustrate people who have previously tried to push the biggest US radio company into bankruptcy. Failing to pay on time some of their bonds could also trigger CDS referencing CCU, which would inevitably reshuffle holders of the company's debt, making negotiations of a turnaround plan potentially easier. If a company which has plenty of cash and intentionally defaults on a maturity payment triggers CDS, many market participants will certainly be left scratching their head. Investors did not wait to get a definitive answer on that issue and they decided to bid aggressively short dated protection, which incidentally pushed all old series of CDC HY sharply wider.
"
"Not What They Expected For Christmas. Back in March, METFNL ( Metro AG ) announced that it would proceed with a demerger in order to separate its food business from its Consumer Electronics business. The latter will be renamed Ceconomy and METFNL’s shareholders will receive 1 share in the new company for every METFNL share they own. On the back of the presentation made by the management yesterday, it is now expected that almost the entire funded debt of METFNL will remain with the wholesale and food service company – Metro WFS. That means that there will not be a split of CDS currently referencing METFNL. They will reference Metro WFS and not Ceconomy going forward. This is also what triggered Moody’s action, which placed METFNL’s rating on review for possible downgrade. In the absence of more material measures to support MWFS’s financial profile, they suspect that it will not be sufficient to deserve an investment grade at the outset of the demerger. Credit investors apparently did not expect the statement of the rating agency to come out that soon, and they sent METFNL’s 5-year risk premium 17bps wider at 134bps at the close. Even if that is somewhat off the intraday wides of 150bps, that is certainly not what they expected for Christmas.
"
"The Year That Was. Despite a tumultuous beginning of the year where some sectors were under severe stress - most notably the energy sector -, it has been generally speaking a good year for credit investors, as shown by the bright green colour of the above grapple. In most areas, not only have they earned some carry, but they also benefitted from decreasing risk premia, thanks to the aggressively accommodative policies of central bankers. However, if you click on the “bomb” icon – in the top right corner - to get access to the performances of individual names, you will see that they have differed massively from one single reference entity to the other. In sovereign land, despite their recent wobble, emerging markets fared very well over the last twelve months, while Italy and Portugal got trashed. Commodity related companies had a really good run in 2016, while the year was much more complicated for Financials, especially banks which had to deal with the US Department of Justice and peripheral institutions.

This will be the last blog of the year, and the teams of Hellebore Capital Management and Hellebore Technologies both wish you all a very merry Christmas!


"
"All Bulled Up. First and foremost, the teams of Hellebore Capital and Hellebore Technologies both wish you all a Happy New Year! 
As far as markets were concerned, 2017 experienced a much more positive start than 2016. There was no need to activate circuit breakers, no limit down on Chinese equities. It actually looked very much like a “risk on” start to the year, and equities and credit were trading up (i.e. risk premia were trading down) while interest rates were trading down (the Bund was the notable underperformer and lost more than a figure). It was allegedly a busy day in terms of credit linked notes issuance, which provided the market with a consistent stream of protection sellers, especially in the financial space. It was enough for the credit market to erase its end of year consolidation and it is now back to the tightest December levels. Investors have so far decided to ignore the note of caution sounded by a French investment bank, which forecast iTraxx Main and iTraxx Crossover to touch 120bps and 725bps respectively over the next six months…


"
"Best Does Not Mean Good. Investors did not have to wait long to get some action in 2017. It was all about UK retailers today. NXT ( Next Plc ) released a trading update for the period running from Nov 1st to Dec 24th and they delivered the first disappointment of the post-Christmas retail sales reports. Branded full price sales fell 0.4% while the consensus was for a 2.2% increase. The miss stems from retail (-3.5% vs est +0.5%) while Directory (ie online) was in line (+5.1% vs est +5.0%). Consequently, NXT expects pre-tax profit in the current fiscal year to be towards the lower end of its previous estimates, and to be even less the year after. As the company is usually one of the winners during the all important festive period, that statement did not go down very well, and UK retailers’ risk premia were pushed aggressively wider. The 5-year CDS of NXT, MKS ( Marks and Spencer Group Plc ), MTNLN (Matalan Finance Plc) and NEWLOK (New Look Senior Issuer Plc) were marked 13bps, 12bps, 95bps, and 61bps wider at 122bps, 164bps, 1758bps and 839bps respectively.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market enjoyed another positive session and indices closed at new tights for the current series.

"
"They Did It Again. Towards the end of the year, credit derivatives are no exception to financial markets and liquidity is usually drying up. Volumes tend to become fairly thin, especially between Christmas and New Year’s Eve. That is unless some dramatic piece of news reaches the market of course. The announcement of a potential 500Bln Yen ($4.3Bln) write-down instead of an initial estimate of $87mln definitely qualifies. When news hit the wire that TOSH ( Toshiba Corp ) could suffer such a hit after the company admitted it had overvalued CB&I; Stone & Webster, a newly acquired US nuclear unit, investors rushed for the exit and sent its stock 42% lower and its 5-year risk premium 358bps wider, from 86bps to 444bps, in volumes last seen when accounting issues surfaced at the company 18 months ago. Since then, TOSH managed to stop the rot when they announced banks were ready to offer them financial support, under the condition that it draws up business improvement plans.
Meanwhile, the broader credit market took a breather today, and consolidated its stellar start to the year with indices closing a tad wider across the board.
"
"Mind The Gap. Early in the week, NXT’s ( Next Plc ) trading update put pressure on all UK retailers. Yesterday was another tough session for the sector, in the US this time around. KSS ( Kohl’s Corporation ), LTD ( L Brands Inc ), M ( Macy’s Inc ) all announced disappointing holiday sales and store closures, souring market sentiment. As investors extrapolated to all retailers, GPS’s ( Gap Inc ) 5-year risk premium was clobbered during the afternoon and reached 340bps. After the market, when the company released better than expected numbers helped by a focus on product and value which lured shoppers to its stores, everyone was taken by surprise and people rushed to cover short risk positions, making it the best performing credit in the High Yield universe. Today, GPS’s 5-year CDS closed 31bps tighter at 299bps.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market recovered in the afternoon from a weak start early on, and credit indices closed unchanged across the board. 

"
"It Is Down To Basis, Stupid !. In the credit index market, compression/decompression is a theme that is getting a lot of attention. People look at investment grade vs high yield, they look at senior vs sub, emerging markets vs developed markets, and so on. Recently they have focused on the relationship between iTraxx Main (ITXEB)and iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX). Since the beginning of the year, a popular strategy has been to buy ITXEX protection in anticipation of tougher times ahead and of a building issuance pipeline and to sell ITXEB protection in order to get some carry back with the assumption that financials should fare reasonably well. That has pushed ITXEB almost 4bps tighter at 69bps over the last 5 trading sessions, while ITXEX is a couple of bps wider at 290bps over the same period. But so far it has not been backed at a micro level (the latest example being MTNLN – Matalan – which was 3.5pts or 200bps tighter following the publication of its results) and most of the under-performance of ITXEX is down to the relative performance of the bases of these 2 indices.
"
"Financial Blues. The new issue calendar has already been busy so far in 2017. The financial sector has seen its fair share of new deals, brought by banks and insurers alike. Today for instance, Axa SA and NN Group NV each issued more than $1Bln subordinated bonds, while Mediobanca Spa and BPCE also tapped the market. That steady flow of new bonds has weighted somewhat on existing deals and given a bid to single reference CDS, with protection on French banks particularly in demand. On their side, UK names were not helped by recent Brexit discussions. That all contributed to make the financial sector one of the underperformers of the last few sessions, and it pushed iTraxx Financial Senior basis further into negative territory (the index risk premium is tighter than its theoretical risk premium)

Meanwhile, the broader credit market started the day on a weak note with iTraxx Main (ITXEB) and iTraxx Crossover rapidly reaching 70bps and 295bps. They never managed to break these levels decisively though -  positive gamma kicking in (particularly on ITXEB) was enough to keep them in check -, and credit indices spent the afternoon grinding back to unchanged levels across the board.

"
"What They Sold. This morning, DTCC published their volume statistics for the first week of January. They shown that clients have been busy during these few sessions. In the US, after a few defaults were announced in December – among them the unexpected self-imposed credit event of iHeartCommunications -, they have trimmed their exposure to CDXHY by $544mln – they remain long risk for roughly $2.8Bln though – but sold another $4.2Bln of CDXIG protection, increasing their long risk exposure to $41.0Bln on series 27 alone – and $44.4Bln across the 3 most recent series. In Europe, they shown unweathering belief in the investment grade universe and sold a further $5.8Bln protection on iTraxx Main – increasing their long risk position to $23.0Bln on the 3 most recent series – and they sold a further $2.0Bln protection on iTraxx Financial Senior, while they left their iTraxx Crossover unchanged. That explains to a large extent the seemingly unstoppable rally of the first few sessions.
"
"Va Va Voum. We learnt yesterday that VW ( Volkswagen AG ) has reached a second settlement (worth $4.3Bln) with US authorities by pleading guilty to using false statements to import cars to the US. It should help the brand put the diesel emission cheating scandal behind it in the US, but the Dieselgate is by no mean over, and more automakers could be on the hook. Towards the end of the afternoon, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) accused FIAT ( Fiat Chrysler Automobiles ) of using emission cheating softwares in more than 104,000 diesel vehicles sold between 2014 and 2016. Even though the company denied implementing such “defeat” devices, FCA’s stock plummeted 16% and its 5-year risk premium traded all the way up to 330bps before settling at 313bps, still 36bps wider on the day. It was today’s worst performer by a fair margin, and it dragged the whole auto sector wider.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market proved very sticky around 66bps on CDXIG, 70bps on iTraxx Main and 290 on iTraxx Crossover during the whole session. It waited until the final hour of European trading to finally move away from these levels, when the EPA news was used as an excuse to push risk premia wider across the board. The move was limited to 1.5bps on CDXIG and ITXEB and 6bps on ITXEX though, and half of it was even erased before the closing bell.  
"
"Sub Is Flying. Besides the burst of volatility in the auto sector yesterday, one of the salient points of the week was the decompression between senior and subordinated protection in the financial sector. It largely followed a presentation made on Wednesday by SANTAN ( Banco Santander SA ). They announced that they would sell as much as €26Bln of so-called senior non-preferred (SNP) notes: €14Bln in 2017 and another €12Bln in 2018. SNP take losses after equity and junior bonds, but before traditional senior debt. Hence, they are not deliverable into CDS referencing senior debt, but only into CDS referencing subordinated debt. SANTAN’s plan is larger than what investors were previously expecting, and followed issuance of this new type of instruments over the last few weeks by ACAFP ( Credit Agricole SA ) – they were the first to issue such notes in December last year -, SOCGEN ( Societe Generale SA ), BNP ( BNP Paribas SA )  and BPCE. That triggered a wave of relative value trades where people bought subordinated protection and sold senior protection on banks. Indices duly followed, and on the week, while iTraxx Financials was 1bp tighter, iTraxx Financial Subordinated was 8bps wider.
"
"I Guarantee You… No More. The CDS of MRWLN (Safeway Ltd) references the 2018 bonds issued by Safeway Ltd. Because of cross-guarantee provisions, it also covers the debt of Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc which is a substantially riskier entity. But as soon as Safeway’s 2018 bonds are gone, the cross-guarantee goes as well. This morning, Morrison announced a cash tender for up to £180Mln across 3 bonds, including the Safeway 2018 – which has £200Mln outstanding – with a preference for the latter. Potentially, this offer only leaves a marginal amount of the only remaining Safeway Ltd bond. It creates a genuine orphaning risk for CDS referencing Safeway Ltd as the cross guarantee will most likely fall shortly after. While MRWLN’s 5-year CDS was a couple of bps wider at the open with all UK retailers on the back on the renewed weakness of the pound, it dropped almost 30bps when news of the tender hit the wire and closed at 68bps, which is 22bps tighter on the day.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market was a bit weaker across the board on concern Mrs May could be prepared to lead the UK to a hard Brexit and following comments by US president elect suggesting other countries could break from the bloc. Nevertheless, it all happened in limited volumes in the absence of US investors.

"
"What Are We Still Waiting For?. Markets spent yesterday and this morning preparing themselves for Prime Minister Theresa May’s hotly anticipated Brexit speech. With the first hints that Mrs May would signal a hard Brexit given by the week-end press, some investors had been bracing themselves for potentially negative reactions and credit indices were pushed – moderately - wider until UK’s Prime Minister began speaking. Breaching 70bps on iTraxx Main (ITXEB) proved a struggle – it reached 70.5bps at the widest - and we did not learnt an awful lot during Mrs may’s speech compared to what had already been leaked. Brexit means Brexit and the plan is to exit the single market while looking for a “bold and comprehensive” free trade agreement giving the best possible access to… the single market. Other EU countries always viewed the two years following the trigger of article 50 as a period to discuss the divorce settlement while the trading relationship would only be worked out afterwards, making a transitional deal difficult to achieve. But unlike the FX market – which was also rocked by Mr Trump’s declaration that the USD is “too strong” -, the credit market was keen not to challenge the status quo and ITXEB only closed 0.5bps wider than Friday at 69.5bps.
"
"Scratch And Look Under The Surface. Today was option expiry, and it certainly felt like it added stickiness in the credit index market. For instance, iTraxx Main (ITXEB) spent the whole morning wrapped around 70bps – which was an important option pin – with a bid/offer spread inferior to 0.1bp. We had to wait until noon for ITXEB to move 0.5bps, but generally speaking, credit indices did not move at all. The same cannot be said for single names though. With all the air time granted to PM May’s speech yesterday and the arrival of Mr Trump at the White House, it would be easy to forget that the reporting season is now in full swing. And today, some results’ publications generated considerable price moves. PFDLN ( Premier Foods Plc ) issued a profit warning and said that their profits would be 10pct lower than they had hoped. That sent their 5-year risk premium 45bps wider at 412bps. At the other end of the spectrum, QUIBB (Financiere Quick) announced that average restaurant sales per converted Burger King outlets was above €4m on a rolling 12-month basis to end of last calendar year. That sent their 5-year risk premium 161bps tighter at 836bps. 
"
"Where to, Mister Draghi?. Not to the stars, for sure. The uneventful ECB meeting delivered an uneventful trading session in credit index space with no more than 2B€ iTraxx Europe trading today. The credit index implied volatility is offered at 40% on the February expiry, less than 2 basis points per day to be break even. This is looking expensive for a market closing in a 2 basis points interval since the beginning of the year. This is cheap if you look at the past time series and how the credit index market is prone to gap. No index is exempt of this lack of volatility. Today, the only salient market compartment was the European Crossover which saw a descent squeeze in protection with good news on companies across the board, Borapan is being approached on its Fox’s Biscuits unit, Hema  delivering  decent results, Quick  keeping rallying post yesterday numbers. The index members are outperforming the index level by 6bps. The iTraxx Crossover is one of the few indices cheap to its fair value. All other liquid indices are expensive, trading tighter than their fair values. 
"
"Let’s Make The Market Trade Again!. If you are a passive investor in credit indices, 2017 has so far delivered the perfect outcome. There was hardly any volatility. Trading ranges have been incredibly narrow. All indices are tighter or hardly wider, which means you have even earned an extra something on top of your carry. If you are an active trader, you are probably pulling you hair off. The market is priced to perfection! Everyone focuses on the positive aspect of Trumpenomics. Volatility has been crushed, and volumes have been anaemic. Today was no different (CDXIG and CDXHY unchanged on the day at 66bps and 351bps respectively; iTraxx Main and iTraxx Crossover unchanged at 69bps and 286bps; how about that for a strike?) , and people sitting on trading floors probably spent the best part of the morning watching the mighty Roger Federer (almost) back to its best and the afternoon trying to name former presidents, vice presidents and their spouses during the inauguration ceremony. Let’s hope the market will be ready to trade again in the very near future.
"
"Has The Great Unwind Begun?. When people arrived in the office this morning, they took a good long look at what was in their books, and discussed it with their neighbours. It was soon pretty obvious that everybody is wearing the same risks. People are long stocks. They are long US dollar. They are long petrol. They are short treasuries. They are short volatility. They are long credit. And in a very orderly fashion, it seems that they began to trim some of these risks. In creditland, dealers were all too happy to run into buyers of protection and to be given, at last, an opportunity to offload some of the single reference CDS that have cost them so much carry over the last couple of months (roll down will also soon start to be an issue with the roll only a few weeks away) . That is the reason why credit index fair values were hardly changed across the board (the theoretical value of iTraxx Crossover was the odd out after some basis arbitrage activity). Credit indices were a tad quicker to react, and most bases are now back (or close to be) in positive territory.
"
"The (Not So Good) Italian Job. BRITEL ( BT Group Plc ) delivered a double blow to investors. It revealed that the impact of an accounting scandal in its Italian business is nearly four times worse than originally thought. From £145mln, the write down has now ballooned to £530mln. As bad as the news was, it was not the worst though! The company also issued a profit warning for this year and next, as it has begun to factor in the impact of Brexit. While individual consumers are holding up well, the UK’s decision to leave the European Union is translating into weaker demand from public sector customers in the UK and big multinationals overseas. To maintain the dividend, tough decisions will have to be made given BRITEL’s upcoming obligations on pension payments and the prospect of more intense competition for its British consumer business, now that pay-TV leader Sky Plc is offering mobile services and Virgin Media is building more fibre lines. In light of these challenges, investors knocked the stock by almost 18% and pushed BRITEL’s 5-year risk premium 9bps wider, making it one of the only names wider in the European investment grade universe.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market resumed normal service after a couple of days of weakness. All credit indices closed at tighter levels today, with iTraxx Subordinated leading the charge (-10bps at 202.5bps, which is the tightest level of the current series).

"
"The Big Squeeze. It would be fair to say that not much happened since the beginning of the year. Volatility has been very contained. The wider indices (iTraxx Main and iTraxx Crossover in Europe and CDXIG and CDXHY in the US) have traded in narrow ranges, and that transpired in the credit index option market where implied volatilities are remaining rock bottom. Year to date moves are minimal, except for one sub-set: the financial sector. After a brief spell weaker  that lasted until the 12th January, the aggressive trend tighter has resumed on iTraxx Financial Subordinated (ITXEU). From a wide mark of 250bps early December last year, ITXEU closed tonight at 197bps, which is the tightest level of series 26. The most recent leg tighter was driven by UK banks. They benefitted from the good set of results from Sanatnder UK, but investors are also worried about the shrinking pool of obligations which will be deliverable into CDS contracts beyond 2023 (for instance RBS has none and Standard Chartered has only £360mln).
"
"The Mating Dance. After considering mating with more than ten potential media companies, network and cable operators, and fiber optic service providers, VZ (Verizon Communications Inc) was said to be ready to approach Charter Communications regarding a possible tie up. The deal would create a new telecom and cable giant which would overtake Comcast as the number one internet provider in the US, trying to cash in on consumers binge watching Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. The merger is by no mean à done deal though and it would be a tough sale to VZ's investors. In a scenario where VZ acquires Charter Communications at a 20% premium to yesterday's closing price, with one third cash and two thirds stocks, analysts estimate the deal would dilute 2018 profits by more than a third. It would also hurt VZ's balance sheet as more than $35Bln would need to be funded through debt and asset sales. The prospect of such large issuance led investors to push VZ's 5-year risk premium 8bps wider to 77bps, the highest it has been in almost a year.
"
"No, They Can't. The overriding theme of the last few days of the week was undoubtedly government bonds, and more specifically French and Italian. France was penalised by the “PenelopeGate” where the wife of Mr Fillon, the right wing candidate, is suspected of having received public money improperly and by some large sovereign, agency and supranational sector issuance. That pushed the yield of 10Y OATs above 1%. On Wednesday, Italy’s struck down part of the country’s existing election law. While it made the prospect for the anti-establishment Five Star Movement gaining power less likely, the ruling does not eliminate the risk of a potential political deadlock, which some analysts effectively see as a best-case scenario but also means no reforms will be able to be passed. That would leave the Italian economy open to negative shocks and further structural deterioration. It gave a reason to investors to send 10Y BTP’s yield above 2.2%, the highest since early December. It set the scene for a weaker credit market in Europe led by Financials, but the US market is not ready to go wider yet, and credit indices were unable to exit the narrow range they have traded in since the beginning of the year.
"
"“Malevolence Tempered By Incompetence”. This is how Lawfare described on its blog the immigration ban targeting seven Middle Eastern countries which the Trump’s administration decided to put in place over the week-end via an executive order. The US initiative was met by massive protests around the world as well as legal setbacks. Even financial markets, which have so far gave the new American President a vote of confidence, reacted defensively to say the least, and showed their first signs of concern. In creditland, there is still an overhang of single name protection in the dealer community though, particularly in High yield. Up to now, they have been happy to recycle these short risk positions with arbitragers who are helping to keep the market in check as they sell index protection. It will not be long before that source runs dry though, and the market could be more volatile in the coming sessions, especially if we keep exploring wider levels.
"
"Is The Market Ripe For A Leg Wider?. Daily variations are still a far cry from what they used to be during recent crises. A the close of business, iTraxx Main was 1.5bps wider at 73.75bps and iTraxx Crossover 2bps wider at 301bps in Europe, CDXIG was 1bp wider at 66.75bps and CDXHY 4bps wider at 351bps in the US. But today was the first time in a very long while that it felt like something could happen. The squeeze we had in the morning after yesterday’s weak session looks very much like something that has to be expected when a bear market develops. The credit index option market has still not reacted though. Not a single volatility offer budged during the last few days, and that is probably one of the reasons the market is currently well behaved.
"
"Pricing In Political Risk. After a fairly volatile start to the week, sentiment appears to be stabilising somewhat. Despite a bit of intraday nervousness, daily moves were once again minimal. But if you dig a bit more, then there are concerns in some areas. The moves in the credit market, and particularly among financials, most certainly reflect an increase of the perceived political risks. French and Italian names have clearly underperformed other financials, a move that is also obvious in the interest rate market, where France 10Y spread has widened versus other semi-core countries while Italy 10Y spreads have moved to historically wide levels versus Spain. The troubles of Mr Fillon, the candidate of the French republican party who started the year as the clear favourite and is now undermined by a series of reports about him giving public salaries to his wife and children, threaten to derail his bid for the French presidency and have turned next May’s poll into one of the most uncertain in recent history. Italy would probably face a political deadlock if general elections were held. While most other financial institutions’ risk premia have moved sideways over the last week, the seven worst performers of the sector are French or Italian and they explained the underperformance of the sector compared with the broader market.
"
"Playing The Range . It looks as if all the players in the credit market have the same points at the moment. On iTraxx Main (ITXEB) for instance, they buy protection at 68bps and they sell at 73bps where RSI – a technical indicator which estimates whether a security is overbought or oversold – become a bit stretched given the price action of the last few weeks. Today confirmed it and 73.5bps proved too high a hurdle to clear for ITXEB, making the session one to forget for the bears. ITXEB closed 1.75bps tighter at 71.75bps, but it has to be said that its fair value was unchanged on the day. The same was true for iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX), which was unable to clear the 300bps level decisively and closed 6.5bps tighter at 295.5bps while its fair value was 0.4bps wider. Playing the range is possible with credit indices which are the most liquid instruments and allow people to cut or even invert their exposures very easily. Doing the same with single reference CDS is much trickier because of more punitive bid/offer spreads. Inverting the recent trend wider on single names will require some confirmation. They took stock and stopped widening, but today’s moves of ITXEB and ITXEX can be entirely pinned down to change in bases.
 
"
"How Often Can You Default?. NSINO ( Norske Skogindustrier ) already orchestrated last year a restructuring of its debt, which eventually led to a credit event back in April this year. But because it was not deemed a failure to pay its creditors, the triggering of CDS was left up to buyers of protection, and most of them decided to hold on to their “insurance” contracts as they decided to wait and see if further down the line a better pay out could be obtained in case of hard default. They might be vindicated. The company decided yesterday to pre-announce that Q4 2016 results would be below Q3 because of the appreciation of the Norwegian Krona against the Euro and the Pound. They also said they had ended discussions with “a selected group of investors” aimed at refinancing and extending maturities of NSINO’s capital structure. If people knew of NSINO’s intention to address its shorter-term debt, they did not expect such discussions to be already under way, and they certainly did not expect them to come to such an abrupt end. They swiftly factored the news in the short dated risk premium of NSINO. The one-year maturity for instance shot up from 1500bps to 3435bps and the one year probability of default implied by the CDS market is close to 40%. 

Meanwhile, the credit market was well oriented all day long. Post yesterday iHeartMedia CDS auction settlement at 35.5 cts,  all high yield indices in the US are trading without iHeartMedia implying a price increase by at least 64.5cts.  The CDX high yield on the run series traded today one point higher well above 107. 
"
"Divergence. The European investment grade credit index is closing tonight 3.5 bps wider at 75bps while the US credit index is closing only 1bp wider at 65bps. The Europe/US spread has traded above 10bps, a level not seen back early 2014.  Since the beginning of the year, US credit is tighter while Europe credit is wider - similar compared to the performance of the equity benchmarks. Under the surface of the credit indices divergence, credit single name protections are well offered on both side of the pond. The index fair values are only 3bps apart. Speculative positions on the divergence have increased, fuelled by the European agenda storyline and the weakness of France and Italy government bonds. The macro views are far from being reflected in the micro credit markets and the divergence will need open positions to increase higher or it will snap back sharply.


"
"Trench War. MBIA Insurance Corporation the US monoline seriously disrupted by the mortgage crisis in 2008 has since engaged in a trench war in order to avoid any default. The monoline managed over time to reduce its liability on a bilateral basis, avoiding a credit event. Is the fort falling down?  A question was asked to the ISDA’s credit Determination Committee (DC) on an eventual failure to pay on its obligation on a CLO. The 1 year’s CDS premium doubled over the last week but the 5 years CDS is hardly moving. The market does not believe this will be the final wave to overrun the fort.  The company said it fully satisfied payment obligations. The DC has not yet answered the question.

Meanwhile, the credit index market failed to be as optimistic as the equity markets. Despite the better performance of European government bonds, the credit indices in Europe traded weak all day long and they are closing at the wide of the day.

"Backed By Volumes. This morning, DTCC published their volume statistics for the week that ended last Friday. They showed that clients have been busy during these five sessions. They have expressed en masse some macro views, which point towards extreme caution about Europe. On the most recent series of credit indices, while they increased their exposure to investment grade credit in the US and sold a further $2.9Bln of CDXIG – clients are now long risk for almost $44Bln on CDXIG27 -, they bought back $6.5bln of protection on iTraxx Main (ITXEB). That is one of the most aggressive weekly exposure reduction we have seen since DTCC began keeping records in 2011. It represents a reduction of 30% of clients' net position - they are still long risk via ITXEB26, but for $15.4Bln only -. Concerns about Italy and France, and more generally about political risk in Europe, were front and centre and drove the spread between ITXEB and CDXIG to 11bps, the widest level it has been since early 2016 – except that back then, CDXIG was the widest of the two as it suffered from its energy heavy composition -. Towards the close, we had a glimpse of how fast things could unravel though. A magazine reported that ECB President Mario Draghi said at an internal ECB dinner that he sees the central bank maintaining an accommodative stance until the end of his mandate in October 2019. That was enough to send ITXEB 0.5bps tighter at 75.5bps while CDXIG closed 1.5bps wider at 66.5bps.

"Once Bitten, Twice Shy. Over the last 12 months, market participants were caught completely off guard by Brexit and by the results of the US presidential elections. This time, they do not want to find themselves accused of having neglected any tail scenario. So, when the French presidential bid of Republican nominee, François Fillon, begun to falter after allegations he employed his wife and two of his children as paid legislative aides without them effectively working, investors rushed for hedges as the election’s outcome became far more uncertain. They sent the OAT-Bund spread to a 4-year high, they bought protection on iTraxx Main and sent the 5-year risk premium of France above 50bps from 28bps in October. With a few polls showing that, in all scenarios, a victory of the far right – and the explosion of the Euro that might ensue - still does not appear to be in the cards, French election jitters subsided somewhat. However, if the 5-year risk premium of France stopped widening, there was no snap back and it was still trading at recent wides.
"
"Diverging Paths. Once again, over the last week, much attention has been paid to macro factors and political uncertainties across Europe have generated many headlines and credit index moves. It would be easy to forget that the reporting season has not reached an end yet. Investors managed to stay focused though, and the dispersion in the weekly performance of risk premia shows it. Among the winners, MTNA ( ArcelorMittal SA ) announced results that came ahead of expectations. The company said net debt decreased by $4.6Bln to $11Bln at year-end. They added that they will not pay a dividend and stated that a return to investment grade will be a priority. That was music to credit investors’ ears, and they rewarded MTNA by shaving 26bps from its 5-year risk premium. Among the losers, NEWLOK (New Look Senior Issuer Plc) reported numbers that were pretty much at the bottom end of market’s expectations. They also gave a cautious outlook and warned of challenging conditions for next year. It came after S&P; downgraded Matalan further into high yield territory to CCC last week, and Moody’s changed the outlook of House of Fraser. The confirmation of the poor prospects of the UK retailers convinced investors to remark the whole sector wider and NEWLOK’s 5-year risk premium shot up 100bps.
"
"Panic Over. NOBLSP ( Noble Group Limited ) has been fighting to prop up its finance after a torrid 2015 and 2016, during which its share price collapsed and its 5-year risk premium went through the roof amid attacks on its accounting. Last year, the company sold its 49% stake in Noble Agri Ltd for $750m and raised $500m in June through a capital increase. They managed to stabilise NOBLSP’s equity and send the prices of the bonds up, and that they are in a much stronger position now than a year ago to negotiate a deal with a strategic investor. That certainly gave more weight to rumours alleging that NOBLSP would be in early talks about a partnership with Sinochem Group, the Chinese state owned oil and chemical group which could be interested in gaining access to NOBLSP’s global supply chain and has the ambition to be a more globally active energy trader. The deal is by no means certain, but these brighter prospects convinced investors to send NOBPSP’s 5-year risk premium 280bps tighter at 627bps, a level not seen since mid-2015.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market enjoyed a strong albeit quiet session as part of Europe is hitting the slopes for half term. CDXIG and iTraxx Main were 1bp and 2bps tighter at 63.5bps and 73bps respectively, while CDXHY and iTraxx Crossover were 4bps and 5bps tighter at 320bps and 295bps respectively.

"
"It Is Not Over Until It Is Over. TOSH ( Toshiba Corp ) had promised today would be the day the company explains the extent of the troubles in their nuclear business. Instead, the company prompted hours of chaos when, after missing a self-imposed Tokyo lunchtime deadline to release their earnings, they announced in the afternoon they would ask regulators for another month to finalize the report before eventually publishing hours later provisional figures including a $6.3Bln write-down of their nuclear unit. TOSH said they may pull out of nuclear plant construction, and that all options are on the table, including a sale of Westinghouse Electric Co, its nuclear unit, the woes of which prompted last December sell off. They added they also consider selling a majority stake in their memory chips business, a reversal of their previous plan to limit the sale to 20%. Once investors heard that TOSH could be left without their two biggest remaining assets and could be a shadow of their former selves, they realised it could be the end of it as a company with any hopes to grow. They sent the equity almost 10% lower and the 5-year risk premium 100bps wider at 434bps, back to the wides of December.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market stood firm today, despite the wobble of rates and equities during Mrs Yellen’s testimony. Credit indices closed unchanged across the board.

"
"The Roll Is Upon Us. It is now a year that the CDS market has switched to semi-annual rolls – they used to be quarterly -. Every six months, the standard 5-year maturity is extended by six months. On the 20th March, standard 5-year will be pushed from December 2021 to June 2022. When that happens, CDS maturing in December 2021 will become progressively less liquid and will be affected by roll down (the risk premium of a 4.5-year CDS is lower than the risk premium of a 5-year CDS except for really distressed names). That seems to be already playing on traders’ mind and over the last week or so there has been an urge in the market to get rid of unnecessary 5-year CDS protection. It has been mostly felt in Europe, and high beta and financial names have been the most affected. It probably explains why bases have been gradually trending higher (index protection is wider than the theoretical value computed with the risk premia of the constituents) despite the positive tone of the last few sessions which usually goes hand in hand in more negative bases as indices react more rapidly. 
"
"Gold Rush. ABX ( Barrick Gold Corporation ) reported yesterday night their fourth quarter results and beat analysts’ expectations as they managed to lower its cost of producing gold close to their target of $700 per ounce. It was a solid quarter with revenues of $2.2Bln which translated to a free cash flow of $385mln. The company reduced total debt by roughly 19% in 2016 to $7.9Bln and said they plan to cut debt by a further $2.9Bln by the end of 2018, half of which should be achieved in 2017. ABX also boosted their gold production estimate while saying they would manage to lower all in production cost – to between $750 to $790 per ounce – compared with earlier guidance. The management reiterated that their “overarching goal is to grow (their) free cash flow per share” and investors rewarded them by lowering ABX’s 5-year risk premium by 10bps to 95bps, extending its impressive run since the beginning of the year – it started at 157bps -.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market did finally widen a bit – marginally though with iTraxx Main closing at 73bps (+1.5bps), iTraxx Crossover at 295bps (+4bps), CDXIG at 64bps (+1bp) and CDXHY at 324bps (+7bps) -, but once again the single names felt well offered and the widening indices translated into slightly more positive bases.

"
"Food Fight. HNZ ( Kraft Heinz Co ) made an unsolicited $143Bln offer for UNANA ( Unilever N.V. ). Indeed, the latter said today that it rejected a $50 a share proposal – consisting in a mix of roughly $30 in cash payable in USD and 0.222 shares of the new enlarged company – that would create one of the biggest food and beverage companies, ranking second only behind NESTLE ( Nestle SA ) in terms of sales. Despite being rebuffed by the Anglo-Dutch company, HNZ announced they would keep “working to reach an agreement on the terms of a transaction”. Even if the two companies find acceptable terms, the deal could come against a number of hurdles as it would create giant in the sector. They would have to convince the EU that competition would not be impaired. They would also need to convince the UK Prime Minister, who singled out Kraft’s 2010 takeover of Cadbury as an example of a deal that should have been blocked during her bid to gain the leadership of her party. That did not prevent investors to lean on UNANA’s 5-year risk premium though. They sent it 13bps wider to 41bps, as it has some catch up to do to reach HNZ’s, which currently trades at 70bps.

Meanwhile, the broader credit market ended the session only marginally wider, despite having a soft tone during most of the day on the back of a potential left-wing coalition for the French elections, which could prevent pro-markets candidates from reaching the second round.

"
"France, Front and Centre. In the absence of the US, it was a somewhat expectedly low volume session. Once again, most of the action come from sovereign bonds. We saw some widening in credit indices mid-morning on the back of the OAT/BUND spread breaking out to 84bps – that is the widest it has been in 4 years -, as the latest French polls confirmed Mrs Le Pen’s lead in the first round of the presidential election and showed her closing the gap in the second round. Investors pushed iTraxx Main to 74.75bps, iTraxx Financial Senior to 94bps and iTraxx Crossover to 300bps. But that spike was short lived, and as the OAT/BUND retraced almost of its move to settle at 76bps, credit indices did the same and they all closed unchanged on the day across the board. The 5-year risk premium of France found it a bit harder though, and widened 5.5bps to 68.5bps – Germany and the UK are trading at 25bps and 30bps respectively -. That is the widest it has been since the European sovereign crisis in 2011-2012. 
"
"Volumes Are Down. In their effort to improve transparency on the CDS market, Hellebore Technologies are publishing for free on this site daily information on prices of single name CDS and credit indices. They have also been using statistical data – volumes traded on credit derivatives - that were made available to the general population by trade repositories. Their main source of information was DTCC, where most of the CDS trades are reported. The data used to be released by DTCC once a week, with a 3-day lag. That was good enough to get an idea of what was going on the market, without being too demanding on DTCC. So it came as a surprise when DTCC announced that they had stop releasing information about volume in a timely manner effective end of January. What initially started as an initiative to increase transparency on the CDS market is turning into a money making operation. Volumes will still be available but for a fee. From now on, you will only get for free data which are a month old. That is the reason why volumes appear frozen since early February on all our grapples.
"
"""Faute De Grives, On Mange Des Merles"". There are some instances where investors only have limited options when they want to invest in a story. NVFVES (Novafives) is one such example. It designs and supplies machines, process equipment, and production lines for aluminium, steel, glass, automotive, aerospace and metalworking sectors. It is a private company and has no listed equity, but it has some debt outstanding, and CDS referencing it can be written. So when the company announced two orders for a smelter expansion project by a major aluminium company in the Middle-East, investors decided to add some risk and used CDS to do so. They sent NVFVES’ 5-year risk premium 46bps tighter at 507bps over 2 days. Given the impressive performance of the company’s CDS since the beginning of December (it is the equivalent of roughly 10pts in cash terms) when the company released its last set of numbers and suggested it might be close to sealing a deal in the Middle-East, the magnitude of the move left many scratching their heads. But with the roll only a few weeks away, technicals are what they are and the current 5-year CDS might be a better instrument to express a positive view than bonds are at this juncture.
"
"The Collapse Tighter. The credit market felt firm throughout the session. Credit indices would have closed a tad better across the board were it not for a late day wobble following a rapid increase of 4bps to 75bps of the OAT/BUND spread towards the close. The most striking feature of the session was actually the collapse tighter of a number of Crossover names. It is not often that 5 constituents of iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) tighten in excess 30bps for completely unrelated reasons, while the index is left unchanged. SELNVX (Selecta Group BV) closed 100bps tighter at 700bps after an article published in the Italian press mentioned Argenta – an Italian vending machine operator – could be up for sale and that a merger with SELNVX followed by an IPO of the newly created entity would be on the table. DRYMIX (Dry Mix Solutions) closed 45bps tighter at 139bps, after a refinancing of the company’s debt was announced paving the way for an orphaning of the entity. WINDIM (Wind Acquisition Finance) closed 38bps tighter at 262bps after releasing good numbers and saying that they are happy with their current structure. Without many names widening significantly - New Look was the odd one out -, that was enough to send the basis of ITXEX back to its recent wides despite the absence of any sharp move of the market as a whole, which is fairly unusual.
"
"Rewards For The Long Suffering Investors. The bruising first quarter of 2016 is now a distant memory for investors who waged some of their money on commodity related companies.  AALLN (Anglo American Plc), MTNA ( ArcelorMittal SA ) and TKAGR ( ThyssenKrupp AG ) all reported in the last few weeks and beat analysts’ estimates. GLEINT ( Glencore Plc ) was the last to publish numbers yesterday, and they showed that they are also firing on all cylinders. The company swung back into the black in 2016, turning a pre-tax profit of $1.38bln. It reaped the benefits of rising prices in key commodities such as coal, zinc and copper, as well as falling costs and currency fluctuations. It beat consensus on its key target metrics, including net debt reduction. The latter had soared as high as $30bln in 2014 in the wake of the takeover of Xstrata. At the end of last year, it stood at $15.5bln - a reduction of $10.4bln in 12 months -, well below its own target. So much so that Mr Glasenberg said GLEINT should be able to “kick out a big dividend”. Credit investors have already been rewarded with a 1,200bps reduction in the company’s 5-year risk premium. From a high of 1,339bps in January 2016, it closed at 155bps today!
"
"The Ebb And Flow Of Political Risk. It was a day of muted price action, and there were no major moves in creditland. The overall tone was positive though, and credit made up part its underperformance of the last few sessions compared with equities. Investors are still keeping a very close eye on the French elections. The failure of the most leftist candidates to forge an alliance over the week-end and the associated boost it gave to candidates perceived as more market friendly, send the OAT/BUND spread below 70bps, its tightest level in almost 2 weeks. That move was reflected on financials, and more specifically banks, which serve as bellwethers regarding political risk in Europe. iTraxx Financial Senior outperformed iTraxx Main (iTraxx Financial Subordinated even more so), iTraxx  Main outperformed iTraxx Crossover, and iTraxx Main outperformed CDXIG.
"
"The Month That Was. The end of the month has felt a bit squeezy and it was obvious from the price action of single names CDS that the coming roll – which is only 3 weeks away and takes place on March 20th – was in many participants’ mind. Most of them were really keen to sell some 5-year protection that soon will not be “on-the-run” anymore. Political risk was also back with a vengeance, and rising uncertainty in several European countries pushed investment grade credit indices wider. iTraxx Financial indices were used as a proxy to hedge against any adverse scenario that would lead to increase odds of Frexit or Nexit. The combination of these factors led to an underperformance of iTraxx Financial Senior which dragged iTraxx Main wider – it closed 3bps wider on the month at 73bps and underperformed both CDXIG in the US which closed 2bps tighter at 62bps and iTraxx Crossover which closed flat on the month at 291bps -, and a return of bases in positive territory across the board in Europe. Index protection is more expensive to buy than single name protection.
"
"Bla Bla Land. While Mr Trump’s speech has been hailed as “presidential” in tone, the least one can say is that it was light on policy details, with barely any clues on the “historic tax reform”. The President essentially returned to the subject of rebuilding infrastructure, highlighting that he will ask Congress to approve legislation that will produce a $1Tln investment financed by both public and private capital, guided by the now familiar principals of hire American and buy American. It looks as if the positive tone, which contrasted with the inauguration speech, was enough to convince investors to brush aside the hawkish comments made overnight by the Fed’s Dudley and Williams. The solid open in Europe shook the confidence of those holding bearish positions and triggered a wave of short capitulation. CTA, hedge funds and real money investors all rushed for the xit and kept hitting bids on protection until there was nothing left to hit. Credit indices closed tighter across the board (iTraxx Main at 71bps, iTraxx Crossover at 281.5bps, CDX HY at 305.5bps), and CDXIG even reached its tightest level since September 2014.
"
"No They Can't. When one looks at the market over the last few weeks, the tightening trend seems unstoppable, even more so during the last few sessions. But it does not have to be that way, and the widening of the names belonging to the Liberty Media sphere came as a timely reminder. Yesterday, VOD’s ( Vodafone Group plc ) CEO opened the door to expanding the company’s mobile to cable TV alliance with Liberty Global once the companies will have proved that their Dutch venture – sealed at the end of 2016 - is a success. The talk of more ventures, echoed by the CEO of Liberty Global in a separate conversation with reporters, dampened speculation that the two companies were near a closer deal. The risk premia of UPC, IESYRP (Unitymedia), and VMED (Virgin Media) all reacted negatively and were first pushed 5 to 15bps wider at 220bps, 155bps, and 215bps respectively. That proved too tempting to resist for investors who desperately want to exit any shorts though, and these three names eventually closed almost unchanged on the day. All that was left at the end of the session was an underperformance compared to other non-investment grade credits, which were 8bps tighter on average. Risk premia cannot go wider at the moment.
"
"Waterloo or Austerlitz Revisited. The French conservative leader Francois Fillon will face a crucial test this weekend. He is calling his supporters to join a rally next Sunday in Paris. If he fails to gather significant support he could resign as early as next week. The credit market was weighing up the possibility of his departure and Alain Juppe coming back into the race.  This was enough to have investors scaling back their hedges ahead of the weekend. After an intial weak opening, the credit market closed the day on a better tone. The French names, especially the banks, are the best performer of the week with BNP and Societe Generale senior CDS closing 15bps tighter over the week, wrapped around 80bps.  All bets are off, but it could be again quite a surprise for the market and the opinion polls if Fillon’s support is stronger than expected. This is the last stand for Francois Fillon.
"
"There Comes A Point When You Just Have To Let Go. DB ( Deutsche Bank AG ) has finally conceded failure in finding a buyer for Postbank. As a consequence, the German bank has had no alternative but to announce a capital increase that will consist in the issuance of 687.5mln new shares – or €8Bln equivalent - with subscription rights – the subscription period is expected to end on 6th April – and up to €2Bln additional capital accretion targeted over the next 2 years from asset disposals as well as the flotation of a minority stake – up to 30% - in Deutsche Asset Management. The question of sustainable earnings power remains, including a path to improving overall profitability and growing revenue for its revamped trading business, but this operation will help to strengthen its capital and leverage ratios, and to absorb the clean-up of legacy assets. Investors anticipated this breath of fresh air, which follows the US Department of Justice settlement, and drove DB’s 5-year senior risk premium down to 125bps over the last three months - it was another 2.5bps tighter today in an otherwise rather weak market -, bringing it almost back under 100bps - where it used to belong until early 2016 - from a peak of 260bps six months ago.
"
"Contradicting Forces. The session felt weak from the word “go” this morning. There was an obvious need for some credit index protection, which might be explained by the recent heavy bond issuance and by the outflows that have been reported in US HY - $500mln last week -. It was met on the one hand by single reference CDS offer resulting from CLN issuance – especially in the financial sector – and on the other hand by banks still eager to offload protection maturing in December 2021 which soon will no longer be on the run - in a couple of weeks June 2022 will be the standard 5-year maturity -. With a little help from arbitragers, it resulted in enough index protection to cap the widening and at the end of the day moves were contained. These technical specificities have helped the market over the past few weeks, but soon banks’ books will be clean and arbitragers’ appetite for credit index bases at current levels will be satiated. With a rate hike in the US fully priced in March but more to come, with concerns rising about Draghi’s tapering agenda, credit indices might not be that well behaved in the future.
"
"Decompression In The Making?. The trend of moving mildly wider after the big squeeze last week continued once again. Softer equities in Asia initially led the weakness, but as rates began to sell off – the US 10-year traded up to 2.55% after the strong ADP numbers gave the recent trend some additional momentum -, credit indices moved another leg wider before stabilising at their widest levels of the session – 71.75bps for iTraxx Main, 285bps for iTraxx Crossover, 63bps for CDX IG and 323bps for CDX HY -. There seems to be some pain in the higher beta names, and the European High Yield complex is trading heavy in the cash space, pressured by redemptions in HY credit ETF. It translated into an orderly leak wider in credit index land with a bit of decompression thrown in. That trend looks sets to continue unless the lazy long base established in the investment grade universe due to the impending roll gets spooked and starts to rush for the exit in the event of a disappointing ECB meeting on Thursday.
"
"Brex-Hit. British grocers have started raising prices on some products as sterling’s drop leads to increased costs for imported goods. MRWLN (Wm. Morrisson Supermarkets Plc) and Waitrose said unwavering competition means they cannot cover all the costs of the pound’s Brexit induced fall through price increases. The CEO of MRWLN said on a call with reporters today that he is “seeing more price increase coming through to be discussed. Some we try to hold off and some we try to reduce, but the industry can’t defy gravity”. The pressure on expenses has already prompted clashes between grocers and suppliers, including a dispute between UNANA ( Unilver N.V. ) and TSCOLN ( Tesco Plc ) over the price of Marmite. Investors understandably started to worry about the effect of higher costs on margins. They put an end to the UK grocers’ impressive run since the beginning of the year and made them the underperformers of the Consumers Non-Cyclical sector. MRWLN closed 4bps wider at 53bps, TSCOLN 4bps wider at 171bps, and MKS ( Marks and Spencer Group Plc ) 1bp wider at 145bps.
"
"Back For A Second Coat?. AKZANA ( Akzo Nobel N.V. ) is one of the “boring names” included in iTraxx Main. It hardly moves one way or the other, and when it does, it does so reluctantly in sympathy with the broader, index without attracting much interest. Even if the burst of activity that took place over the last couple of days will not transpire in the volume statistics before April - that is because of DTCC's decision to suspend the free access to weekly data in a timely manner -, it clearly impacted AKZANA’s 5-year risk premium. This rare increase in volumes stemmed from a bid the company received from PPG Industries to acquire it for €83 a share. The unsolicited approach was rebuked by AKZANA’s management who said it substantially undervalued the business. With national elections looming next Wednesday, they also played up the rising nationalist sentiment – a few Dutch politicians weighted in against the transaction -, tweeting a Bloomberg News article about their rejection of the approach with the hashtag #DucthPride. Despite headlines suggesting a potential spin-off of the chemical arm of AKZANA, that should not be enough to prevent PPG to come back with a second offer. Having already pushed AKZANA’s 5-year risk premium 4bps wider yesterday, investors marked it another couple of bps wider at 59bps today.
"
"Calm After The Storm?. 2016 proved to be an annus horribilis for the shipping industry. CMACG (CMA CGM), the French company which ranks number 3 in the world in the sector, did not go unscathed. After making $567mln in profit in 2015, they announced on Friday a net loss of $452mln for the full year 2016. But more importantly for investors, they reported a strong 4th quarter, on the back of improving freight rates and cost cuts. Volumes increased thanks to the acquisition of Neptune Orient Lines (NOL), but CMACG has striven to preserve their operational margin rather than conquer market share at all cost. Operational margin remained in positive territory at 0.2% for 2016 as a whole, and it even reached 4.2% in Q4, which should bode well for the year to come. The management delivered an upbeat message during their conference call with analysts, guiding towards improving EBITDA in Q1 2017, continuing freight rates improvements on the key Asia-Europe route, as well as ongoing progress in extracting synergies from the NOL acquisition. Investors rewarded them by sending CMACG’s 5-year risk premium to its tightest level at 588bps.
"
"Oil-Watching, Anyone ?. We will know the decision of the FOMC tomorrow night, but this does not seem to be the main driver for risky assets at the moment, as the rate announcement seems anything but certain. It impacts risk appetite though, and positions appear fairly limited into the FED meeting. With interest rates taking a back seat, investors have had time to pay attention to some of their old favourites, and oil was back on everybody’s radar screens. It traded through $48 a barrel today as Saudi Arabia disclosed an increase in production. It has lost more than 15% since the beginning of 2017, and more than 10% over the last week only. Oil’s drop interrupted the calm that has gripped the market ahead of central banks’ decision – ECB met last Thursday -, and elections throughout Europe which starts tomorrow with general election in the Netherlands. The credit market was on the back foot, and the energy sector was the most impacted, particularly High Yield names in the US. CDX HY closed 7.5bps wider at 344bps and iTraxx Crossover 4bps wider at 291bps, while CDX IG closed 1bp wider at 66.5bps and iTraxx Main 1.5bps wider at 74bps.
"
"A Day Better Spent In The Park. Today was all about options expiry in the CDS market. The recent weakness felt over the last few sessions had managed to bring credit indices through important pins – open positions on the 65 strike for CDX IG and 72.5 strike for iTraxx Main (ITXEB) were significant -, but it was not enough to break them decisively. As soon as investors started to cover “in the money” options – and they began to do so early in the session -, CDX IG and ITXEB traded down to 65bps and 72.5bps respectively and spent the best part of the day wrapped around these levels. Credit hardly moved at all after the initial move tighter. The sharp bounce in oil – even though it looked like fading into the close – certainly helped the positive tone, and except for these option-related flows the rest was position squaring ahead of the FOMC. Credit is not priced to perfection – ITXEB and CDX IG were 3bps and 4bps tighter respectively a week ago – but there is not an awful lot of room for error and we better have that dovish hike now.
"
"From Bust to Boom. The last 15 months have marked a spectacular reversal of fortune for commodity related companies. They have gone from bust to boom, and are back in fashion. Nevertheless, news that Mr Agarwal, an Indian scrap metal trader turned billionaire mining tycoon, plans to buy as much as £2Bln of AALLN (Anglo American Plc) shares in the market according to a statement from Volcan Investments Ltd, a holding company owned by the Agarwal family, came as a surprise. That would make him the second largest shareholder with 13% of the company. While this is a secondary market transaction and no fresh capital is injected into AALLN, the first order impact on credit is neutral. However, the ultimate motivation of such a move are still unknown. It could be a first step towards closer ties with Vendanta Resources, the mining company founded by Mr Agarwal, which is smaller – it has a £2.4Bln market capitalisation – and has weaker credit metrics. That is certainly what worried investors when they pushed AALLN’s 5-year risk premium 6bps wider at 176bps and made it underperform its peers.
"
"A Dovish Hike. At the end of their meeting, the FOMC decided to raise interest rates on Wednesday. As expected by the market, they delivered a 25bps hike to the Fed funds rates. They also only made minor changes to their projections, and in her press conference, Mrs Yellen largely reaffirmed that there was no change in the Fed’s thinking of the economic or policy outlook. She also added that 2% inflation is a target rather than a ceiling and acknowledged that it could temporarily shoot above that level. That part probably took the market slightly off guard, investors having positioned themselves quite defensively ahead of the decision. That led to some eye-catching moves on interest rates, with 2y and 10y US rates rallying roughly by 10bps. The effect was also felt in the credit market, and indices moved aggressively tighter after the decision – they are back to the tightest levels of the current series, ie 70bps for iTraxx Main and 61bps for CDXIG -. The results of the Dutch general elections also played their part and added another feel-good factor, but anyone who would not be aware of the actual FED’s decision would be forgiven to assume they had stayed put!  
"
"Spread Hunter. The spring equinox, at 10:28, UK time, was preceded at 08:00 am, by the credit index roll. On-The-Run credit indices in Europe are the Series 27 and, in the US, the Series 28. The 5 years’ standard contract, the most liquid one, is now maturing in June 2022.  The extension of maturity from December 2021 to June 2022 has a cost. The new indices are trading wider than the former indices. The iTraxx Europe is trading 7bps wider, the Crossover 22bps, the CDX.NA.IG 6.5bps.  These additional premia are lower than what the index members are suggesting. The new CDX.NA.IG should be 10bps more expensive.  This is a reflection of the investors positioning. Investors are long risk on US investment grade indices, additional premium is always a bargain. The investors bought back protection on former series to sell protection on the new one. On the attached Grapple, we notice that the new index is trading much tighter than its fair value while former indices are cheaper. The spread hunters have chased today the pick-up in premia.

"Action at last!. It looks as if everyone tuned it to watch the French presidential debate yesterday night and decided that Mr Macron – moderate candidate - put a decent enough performance that comforted them in the belief he will crush Mrs Le Pen – far right candidate - if the pair were to face each other in the decisive second round of the election. Everybody seemed to cheer, and the credit market squeezed pretty hard in the morning – iTraxx Main (ITXEB) was a couple of bps tighter at 74bps and iTraxx Crossover 8bps tighter at 287bps -. But the sentiment switched in the afternoon as it surfaced that Mr Trump’s healthcare bill could potentially not pass Congress. All of a sudden, investors seemed to question his ability to get the planned tax cuts through and the whole reflation trade appeared to fade in the second part of the afternoon. Credit indices went back very quickly to unchanged levels on the day. At the end of the session, the only sign of the intraday volatility was the bases which all closed more positive, as the speed of the move left single names behind.

"Always Read The Small Prints. The new series of CDX HY, the benchmark for high yield credit in the US, will be launched next Monday. Series 28 will bear a Jun 2022 maturity like all other 5-year indices launched in March 2017, and, like previous series of CDX HY, it will include 100 constituents. That might not last long though. When SHLD ( Sears Holdings Corp ) released their annual 10-K filing yesterday, they added so-called going concern language. Acknowledging “substantial doubt” about its future raised fresh concerns about the survival of the company among investors who sent the stock tumbling down and the 5-year risk premium through the roof. The company tried during the day to calm things down and said they remained focused on executing their transformation plan, which includes assets sales and an aggressive cost cutting program. It stopped the rot, but SHLD was still the worst performer of the consumers sector today.
"
"Does One Sparrow Make A Summer?. The credit market was a bit soft first thing this morning. However, as the day progressed, a general risk-on tone emerged in the higher beta CDS names. In particular, UK retailers were active following NXT’s ( Next Plc ) numbers. Since 2016, its 5-year risk premium has experienced a bumpy ride, and has been on a constant widening trajectory. Many analysts thought that guidance would be lowered again today, but NXT’s CEO surprised them by maintaining his forecast that profit will fall between £680mln and £780mln. With the fall in the pound since the vote to leave the EU spurring inflation and squeezing disposable income, the mere confirmation that no additional weakness should be expected was enough to cheer investors. They sent the stock up 8% and the 5-year CDS a more modest 4bps tighter at 132bps. 
"
"Oil-Fuelled Decompression. After a few months a stability, oil experienced a tumultuous month of March. Over the last four weeks, it has slid more than 10% amid supply woes. Russia’s policy makers are leaning on the cautious side. They said they were using below consensus estimates - $50/barrel on average in 2017, falling to $40/barrel at the end of 2017 and then staying near that level during the 2 following years – to establish growth forecasts in an economy still driven by oil to a large extent, adding to the market nervousness in doing so. That certainly goes a long way in explaining the underperformance of the energy heavy CDX HY compared to its investment grade benchmark equivalent, CDX IG. Since the 24th February, CDX IG series 27 – series 28 did not exist at the time – has tightened by 3bps to 60bps, while CDX HY series 27 has widened by 7bps to 327bps. Using a standard beta and thus assuming 1bp of CDX IG is equivalent to 5bps of CDX HY, it means HY has underperformed IG by almost 1 percentage point in cash price over the last 4 weeks.
"
"Reallocation. Credit never really felt vulnerable today. Despite a wider open - iTraxx Main (ITXEB) +1.5bps @ 76.5bps and iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) +8bps @ 300bps - on the back of doubts surrounding Mr Trump’s ability to push through his reform agenda following the health care bill fiasco, the price action was strong from start to finish. Sellers of protection emerged early on, as some investors were eager to use these better entry points to get rid of hedges or add risk, and credit outperformed equities throughout the session. Volumes were not massive, but reallocations appear under way. Risk was transferred from US into European credit in the ETF space, which translated into a 1bp underperformance of CDX IG compared with ITXEB and a 5bps underperformance of CDX HY compared with ITXEX. The probability that the Federal Reserve will raise rates two more times this year has dropped back below 50%. That is quite supportive for IG credit, and forced another round of bullish decompression. Financials are still trading very firm, despite some questions asked about UK banks as Article 50 is about to be triggered, and the spread between ITXEB and iTraxx Financials is down to 13bps – 75bps vs 88bps -, the tightest it has been in almost a year.
"
"Because Renting Also Means Selling. Much has been said recently about the energy sector which has been put under severe pressure – albeit nothing similar to the bloodbath of late 2015 early 2016 – and was singled out as one of the factors behind the underperformance of the high yield universe in the US compared to investment grade. Car rental companies have also played their part. A week ago ALLY ( Ally Financial Inc ) warned on profit and drew investors’ attention to decreasing used-car prices. Concern is effectively mounting, as consumers have recently turned to leasing more than ever before to lower their monthly payments on new vehicles which are selling at record prices in the US. A surging number of cars coming off leases is fuelling a supply glut and dragging down prices. The National Automobile Dealers Association’s Used Car Guide index declined 3.8% in February, the eighth consecutive drop and the steepest since November 2008. That has consequently sent alarm bells ringing regarding car rental companies which could be forced to boost provisions against future losses. Since the 21st of March, HTZ’s ( The Hertz Corporation ) 5-year risk premium jumped 45bps to 717bps and CAR’s ( Avis Budget Group Inc ) jumped 36bps to 462bps.
"
"How To Stop The Chain Reaction. TOSH ( Toshiba Corp ) acquired Westinghouse in 2006 for $5.4Bln. It was a bet on a rebirth in nuclear projects on the back of high oil prices, based on the assumption that governments would cap carbon emissions to prevent global warming. Ten years down the road, after many of its projects were dogged by delays and cost overruns, Westinghouse filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. While TOSH estimated a month ago that writedowns related to its nuclear adventure had swelled to $6.3Bln, the company announced today that its liabilities totalled $9.8Bln. For TOSH, the aim of the Westinghouse’s filing is to fence off its soaring liability, but it will no doubt trigger a host of legal questions about whether TOSH remains responsible for losses at Westinghouse. Expectations that the company may be too big to fail for the Japanese government have been bolstering its bonds so far, but these once again revised numbers could be denting investors’ confidence. They sent TOSH’s 5-year risk premium 27bps wider to 450bps, but their concerns were best shown by TOSH’s 1-year risk premium which jumped 50bps to 772bps and is back to the wides.
"
"The Day After. Since the UK decided to leave the EU in June last year, the British economy has been in a pre-Brexit sweet spot, especially regarding export. The pound has fallen but trading rules are as yet unchanged. While most forecasts were predicting an economic impact even before the UK’s actual exit, they have proved so far too pessimistic, despite the obvious uncertainty. A layer of uncertainty was removed yesterday though, as Article 50 was finally triggered by PM May, launching officially the 2-year exit period for Great Britain to leave the EU. Clashes should materialise in the very near future, with Mrs May calling for the discussion of future partnership with the EU alongside the terms of exit, while Mr Tusk said the EU will focus solely on an orderly withdrawal to begin with. Investors brushed these concerns away, and decided to focus on upwardly revised US fourth quarter growth numbers. Credit markets were very well behaved today again (iTraxx Main -0.25bps @ 74.5bps, iTraxx Crossover -1.5bps @ 290.5bps, CDX IG -0.75bps @ 67bps and CDX HY -4.5bps @ 339bps), and the day after looked very much like the day before.
"
"The Week That Was. It feels like the FED and the ECB have been on a mission all week long to lower interest rate hikes expectations on both side on the Atlantic, and regain some sort of flexibility on when/how to tighten financial conditions. The immediate impact has been a recorrelation of rates and equities, which both rallied. As far as it was concerned, credit traded in a tight range, with a clear outperformance of the investment grade universe though. With a few extended week-ends on the horizon, low beta carry trades have become quite fashionable. For instance, 5-year 10-year steepners on iTraxx Main (ITXEB) – where one buys protection on June 27 maturity and sells protection on June 22 - gained 3bps since the roll and ITXEB S27 10y is now trading 42bps above ITXEB S27 5y. It is hard to feel any sense of urgency to hedge risk related to the French elections – the first round is 3 weeks away – nor any real concerns around Brexit which was officially launched on Wednesday. The only discordant factor was iTraxx Financial Senior, which seems to have found a floor at 89bps where it finished the week.
"
"The ""Der des Ders"". When we try to say  ""this is the very last one"", same as the French expression “Der des Ders” spoke about WWI, we should be cautious. The Portuguese government agreed to sell 75% of Banco Novo to the American Private Equity Lone Star for 1BEuros.  It is supposed to be the final chapter of the Banco Novo saga with a final capital injection. The same government invested 4.9BEuros in 2014 in the bailout of the collapsing Banco Espírito Santo through a special entity, the Resolution Fund.  Ever since, the bank kept accumulated losses on its loan portfolio. The Resolution Fund will take on the loss, not in marked to market, but in liabilities to be jointly repaid by all Portuguese banks over the next 30 years. The government is also committed to add capital if CET1 ratio would fail below 12.5%.  The only actual loss is limited to 500MEuros on bondholders who, on a voluntary basis, will get new debt. Most of the invoice is levied onto the next generations. The CDS market reacted to the news with premium wider as the debt exchange could trigger the CDS. This could end the saga of the Banco Esperito Santo CDS, the “Der des Ders” for the CDS.  In 2014, the contracts failed to protect correctly the CDS holders. New CDS credit definitions are been used now.

Meanwhile, the credit market was weaker, especially in Europe and its financial complex. The credit indices were well bid all the session long but with limited flows reported. 

"
"Fashion Obsolescence. The day Ralph Lauren announced it is closing its Flagship in NY to adjust its operations, The Neiman Marcus Group LLC (NMG) has few options left. The company is operating the 2 Bergdorf Goodman stores in Manhattan and 42 Neiman Marcus stores across the United States.  The company is focusing on luxury retail operations. The company is private since a LBO by TPG in October 2005. TPG sold wisely NMG in 2013 to Ares Management and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. The company is a high yield credit since 2005. NMG is member of all CDX.NA.HY vintages, for series 6 to series 28, since March 2006. A classic of the high yield portfolios. The story is turning sour. Brick and mortar retail operations are struggling. The new generation is purchasing online and away from the classics. LBO sponsors have extracted as much value as possible leaving the company highly leveraged – 5BUSD of debt -  at a time of consumers walking away from US malls. The credit default swap premium has been multiplied by 3 since the beginning of the year, trading today at 1,500 bps or 27% upfront plus 5% running, a 75% probability of default over the next 5 years. The market is pricing a restructuring of the whole company. Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) form Canada was rumored to be interested to buy NMG but at a huge cost for bondholders. HBC is also rumored to be interested in Macy’s which is also for sale. Retailers are on the catwalk.

Meanwhile the credit indices traded firmly, the IG US index outperforming the IG European index.
"
"A Pin for Staples. On the catwalk yesterday, Staples was rumored to be in discussion with private equity groups to take the company private. The US and UK supermarket for office supplies is struggling with its business model.  When you buy an ink cartridge, you always wonder how they can struggle, but they are indeed struggling, with online and brick and mortar retailers. To “Make it Happen” - for shareholders - the company thinks it would be better to be taken private. Would it be easier to chase again a merger with Office Depot? This merger was blocked by the FTC in May 2016.  SPLS stock price was up 5% again today, 16% over the last 2 sessions. After jumping yesterday by 35 bps, from 206 bps to 241 bps, the 5Y CDS premium was pinned at the same level all day long. Being at the limit of the investment grade and the high yield, the credit investor will be very demanding to add more debt on the company to finance a LBO. This should be taken into account by equity investors.

Meanwhile, the credit index market was strong especially when the US came in. More activity was reported compared to the beginning of the week.

"
"Mario Draghi's Reflective Assessment. The president of the ECB delivered today another reflective assessment on his policy - ECB Policy is working and the dovish forward guidance is legitimate. But Dr Weidmann is not so sure to give a ‘first’ to his colleague (and boss). The ECB keeps buying time either with its monetary policy or its banking supervision. On the latter, declaring the Italian regional lenders, Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza, solvent is just an opinion as NPL valuation is not a science. How many NPL valuations have been too optimistic over the last 10 years, in Europe and in the US? ECB being lenient, the Italian government can keep bailing out its banking system. There is a time to look for an external assessment of the central bank policy. The CDS market gave indeed a ‘first’ to Mario Draghi. The European financial CDS has outperformed today the broader CDS market. The indices traded all the way tighter in a straight line during the European session. But buying time is no more than a ‘2.2’ grade.  Looking at France having bought time over the past 5 years and having not solved its structural issues, Mario Draghi should look for more exemplarity to deserve a ‘first’.
"
"Spring  Rolls. 
Last 20th March, the CDS market served one of its best exotic dishes: the CDS and indices rolls. 
This was the latest  opportunity for the DataGrapple team to update the Grapples. 
First, we increased the set of names covered. We then removed those unfortunate names which have defaulted over the last 6 months since the last update. 
The new names include CDS which were never quoted before and which are now members of the on-the-run series. 
In March, Europe added 3 such names in the iTraxx Crossover: 
CLNX ( Cellnex Telecom SA) - the Spanish operator of telecommunications towers, spun out from Albertis in 2015, 
CSTM ( Constellium NV ) - the producer of aluminium cans but also elements for planes and cars (CSTM includes former French Pechiney activities and Arconic is its main competitor), 
SPMIM ( Saipem SpA) - the Italian offshore driller service operator, backed by ENI. 
Given that these CDS have never traded before, DataGrapple computes alleged prices displayed with dotted lines on the attached Grapple. 
The method is simple: we assign an expert cluster to each new name as a function of its rating, its region and its sectors. 
Using the first 10 days of trading, we compute the average ratio of the actual spread to the associated cluster average. 
Applying this ratio to the cluster center time series, we get an indication of where these CDS could have traded in the past, back to 2006.


The DataGrapple team has also updated the Machine Clusters, defining sets of CDS following the same trading pattern. 
The new clusters can be compared with the former one using the Sankey Grapple available in the GrappleStore. 
The addition of the recent period does not add much information. 
Worthy of mention, the European retailers are moving out of the consumer non-cyclical cluster into the global European corporate cluster including cyclicals. 
They do look more sensitive to the economic environment than the beverage producers.


Meanwhile, the credit market displayed little sensitive to Syria. Activity was subdued and intraday volatility was close to zero.

"
"Red Alert. When the session is weak, particularly in the afternoon, it is fairly common to see credit index bases – the difference between the quoted value of a credit index and the theoretical value computed with its individual constituents - go wider, as indices tend to react faster than their constituents. And the session was weak today in the morning after polls showed that France might be tempted to elect a communist president – Mr Melenchon says he is not, even though the communist party endorsed him, but most cannot see the difference –, with the election now becoming a four-horse race – the far right, the right, the centre-left and the far-left candidates all currently seem to stand a credible chance to appear in the second round -. And it got weaker into the close when rumours that China – swiftly denied by the Chinese foreign ministry though - had gathered troops on the North Korean border surfaced in the market. That explains the move wider of most European credit index bases, but only part of the basis move of iTraxx Crossover’s (ITXEX). Indeed, QUIBB (Financiere Quick) announced a refinancing operation that will almost certainly leave the current CDS without any deliverable debt.  QUIBB’s 5-year risk premium closed 394bps tighter at 157bps, which is the equivalent 5bps of ITXEX or 25cts. QUIBB’s CDS tightening alone explains half of the 50cts move of ITXEX’s basis.
"
"Already Running Out Steam?. It all began as if it could be a rather ugly session. Credit indices traded wider as soon as they opened, and reached rapidly the wides of the new series (Itraxx Main @ 77.5bps and iTraxx Crossover at 295bps). But then they found it very difficult to breach these levels. With, the OAT/Bund spread – the difference in yield between French and German 10-year bonds –, which has been the best French election induced stress thermometer, stabilising at 75bps around mid-morning, the reach for protection seemed to run out of steam. Despite all the noise about geopolitical risk, all the headlines about Korea, Turkey and Russia, there was no follow through in the initial weakness. Everyone realised that the Easter week-end is a only couple of days away and that exiting hedges could prove tricky if sentiment turned for any reason. All of a sudden everyone had enough protection on their book, and even options’ implied volatility stopped trading up. While during the last few sessions every option trade was the opportunity to rerack implied volatility higher and the offer that got lifted became the new bid, options to buy protection were offered on this afternoon. It might not last, but today market participants felt (too) short risk.
"
"Once They Used To Move…. There was a time when news of a price war among UK retailers would have put pressure on their credit risk premia. Even if today’s commitment by TSCOLN ( Tesco Plc ) to keep prices low is not price war per se, it will certainly ratchet up the pressure on an industry that already faces shrinking profitability, as sterling’s decline pushes up the cost of imported products. TSCO’s CEO said that “there is inflationary pressure there, but we try and offset everything we possibly can by working with our supplier base”, confirming that life will not get any easier for UK retailers. TSCO’s stance means that pressure on margins across the industry is nowhere near abating, especially when one takes into account the relentless growth of discounters Aldi and Lidl. While equity investors took stock of the situation and marked UK retailers’ lower - making them the worst performing group of the FTSE -, it is impossible to discern them on the above grapple where colour indicates the direction and magnitude of the move – the bigger the move, the brighter the colour; red means wider risk premium; green means tighter premium -. They were as bland as all the other names.
"
"Gone Egg Hunting. DTCC has still not changed the revised policy of only releasing data regarding volumes 4 weeks in arrears, so we will not know for sure until late May, but relatively little risk changed hands today. It was another defensive, tight range session. Caution is still the order of the day, even if recent polls are showing dwindling support for Mr Melenchon in the first round of the French elections as people are paying now more attention to his program. Variations on the day were minimal on credit indices (iTraxx Main and CDXIG unchanged at 77bps and 67bps respectively, iTraxx Crossover and CDX HY 1bp tighter at 294bps and 344bps respectively) and single name reference CDS, even if the latter continued somewhat to play catch up with former, reducing bases in the process. In fact, many people were already away from their desk today and seem to have grabbed the opportunity offered by the fine weather to go egg hunting earlier than usual.
"
"Orphan… No More!. Following the full redemption of UNILSUB’s (Unilabs Subholding AB) senior secured fixed rate and floating rate notes initially due in 2018 and the redemption of their second lien PIK notes initially due in 2019, the company has had no outstanding debt since October 2016. This redemption had long been anticipated, and UNILAB’s 5-year risk premium had been reflecting a very low probability of default long before this date, as the above grapple shows. But even in early 2017, albeit low, UNILSUB’s probability of default has never been zero. Indeed, a 5-year CDS protects the buyer for a 5-year period, and no deliverable debt at one point in time does not necessarily means that no debt will ever be deliverable. The issue of €250mln of 8-year by UNILSUB today vindicated investors who held to their CDS contracts since last October. From a low of 90bps at that time, UNILSUB’s 5-year risk premium shot up to 380bps today at the close, which more than makes up for the premium they had to pay during this 6-month period. CDS contracts referencing entities with no deliverable debt are known as “orphaned” in the market, but unlike us human, a CDS is orphaned until it is not.
"
"Back To Basic Materials. Over the last few weeks, macro concerns have grabbed most of investors’ attention. Most notably, the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the French presidential election and the distinct possibility of a second round opposing the far right candidate to the far left candidate has led to extreme caution, which translated into minimal variations as investors are reluctant to position themselves one way or the other. Idiosyncratic moves have been few and far between, so the recent weakness in the basic material sector is worth highlighting. These credits are the worst performers since the beginning of the week. Iron Ore is trading at a five-month low and has lost 25% since mid-March. It dropped almost 4% yesterday alone, and miners and steel producers saw their risk premia jump. Compared with last Friday, the 5-year CDS of MTNA ( ArcelorMittal SA ), AALLN (Anglo American Plc) and TKAGR ( ThyssenKrupp AG ) were trading 17bps, 8bps and 8bps wider at 266bps, 210bps and 159bps respectively today at the close. Investors are bracing themselves for more volatility in the sector, as some iron ore producers are ramping up output which will not help reduce the glut which last year already stood at 70 million tonnes.


"
"A Long-Lasting Affair. 11 years ago, the Benetton family who controlled ATLIM ( Atlantia SpA ) via their holding Edizione – it has a 30.25% stake in the Italian toll road company -, attempted to merge it with its Spanish peer ABESM ( Abertis Infraestructuras SA ). The transaction was then blocked by former Prime Minister Romano Prodi’s government. It looks that the project was never completely abandoned though, and discussions between the 2 companies have resumed, with the blessing of Caixa, ABESM’s main shareholder – they own roughly 22% -. ATLIM released a statement on Tuesday saying that “a very preliminary and generic interest to examine common projects” had been expressed to ABESM. Because deals equal potential financing, ATLIM’s 5-year risk premium was sent 11bps wider to 95bps. Today, details of a possible deal structure emerged. While ABESM could be valued at €16Bln, the offer may include as much as €10Bln in cash – with the rest paid in stocks – and ATLIM could seek up to €8Bln in financing for the deal, thus confirming investors’ early intuition. After consolidating some of its widening yesterday, ATLIM’s 5-year CDS was back to 95bps at the close.
"
"Ready, Steady.... No liquidity, no trade. That pretty much sums up the day on the credit market. Variations were minimal intraday or on a close to close basis. That was true for indices and their constituents alike, even if on balance risk premia were indicated a tad tighter for choice. Instead of trading, people spent most of the day trying to assess where the market could open on Monday based on the outcome of the first round of the French presidential election. Using the probabilities they affect to each of these outcomes, the general conclusion was that 75ish bps is probably the correct level for iTraxx Main (ITXEB) on the eve of the ballot. If people use probabilities that appear to make sense, it seems that the market behaviour after the most recent shock election results and the speed at which risky assets came back to their original levels is impacting their expectations for next Monday’s opening levels. In my humble opinion, the market reaction to a second round Le Pen / Melenchon face-off would be far worse than the 100bps open for ITXEB most people see. Even if we have all been lamenting the low realized volatility of the last twelve months, let’s hope this particular guesstimate won’t be tested.
"
"Ouf!. The market breathed a huge sigh of relief this morning, after the French presidential election failed to deliver any shock over the week-end. Make no mistake though, viewed over a longer-term horizon, it is another shockwave as the two mainstream parties’ candidates have been eliminated and the general elections that will take place in a couple of months will no doubt bring their lot of uncertainties. If no majority emerges in Parliament, the task of the future President – Mr Macron as it stands at the moment, unless any unexpected twist turns things on their head over the two coming weeks– will be made extremely difficult and reforming the country will be as tricky as ever. But today was all about celebrating the very likely election of a pro-Europe candidate. It seems that investors were positioned fairly defensively – this was obvious from credit index option prices last week as the implied volatility of out of the money downside protection was far more expensive than at the money downside protection, but less so on credit indices themselves – and the risk premia of credit indices reaped tighter. iTraxx Main opened 4.5bps tighter at 70bps and closed a further 2bps tighter at 68bps; iTraxx Crossover closed 18.5bps tighter at 272bps; itraxx Financials Senior closed 12.5bps at 78bps and iTraxx Financials Subordinated 27.5bps at 175bps.
"
"Unstoppable. France’s big banks were the main beneficiaries of the country’s first round of the presidential election. They were the best performers yesterday by a fair margin, and the risk premia of their senior and subordinated debts collapsed, despite some light profit taking on long risk positions during the session. They enjoyed another very positive day today, even if peripheral financial institutions stole the show - they were playing catch up, having lagged a bit their French counterparts yesterday -. Despite the backup in OATs, there was no stopping French banks. ACAFP ( Credit Agricole SA ) issued a new 10y obligation roughly 50 to 70cts cheap to existing bonds, but the discount was gone as soon as it started trading. The €1.5Bln new issue had no lasting impact on the bank’s 5-year CDS – nor on any other maturity – and it closed another 3.5bps tighter today at 60.5bps.
"
"Most Paused, Some Did Not. Monday and Tuesday were all about the capitulation of hedge fund managers who held short risk positions into the first round of the French presidential election. Today marked this week’s first session of consolidation. Credit indices bounced off the tights as investors reduced a bit their strategic long risk positions ahead of the ECB meeting tomorrow. Single reference entity CDS also made a pause, but among them Financials continued to perform with CS (Credit Suisse Group AG) showing the way. The CEO announced that the bank is eventually bowing to investors’ pressure by abandoning the partial sale of its biggest profit generator, its Swiss Universal bank, and said that it will instead boost capital through a right offer. The bank will raise 4 billion Swiss Francs from the share sale. CS also posted a first quarter profit of CHF 596mln which beat analysts’ expectations of CHF 336mln. Investors celebrated the results together with the end of what were weeks of speculation regarding the funding plan by sending CS’s 5-year risk premium another 5bps tighter to 89bps.
"
"Is The Party Over?. Steel industry credits in the US charged in the wake of Donald Trump’s election as president. The promise of heavy infrastructure spending and protectionist trade policies for manufacturing both represented major demand driver for steel suppliers, after cheap imported steel made their life difficult in recent years and stiff price competition weighted on margins. The recent struggles to pass the healthcare reform bill have led to scepticism regarding the likelihood of imminent sweeping changes to trade policy, and the market has begun to look more sceptically at the post-election surge. X ( United States Steel Corporation ) has been the most impacted, and their earning report yesterday did nothing to quell investors’ fears. Despite rising metal prices, the company announced a $180mln loss for the first quarter and cut full year guidance. While others were investing to improve technology and costs during the downturn, X was trying to save money and put off investments. To fix this deficiencies, management said it accelerated equipment upgrades, but disruption caused by these efforts will ultimately cap the company’s ability to participate in the current favourable conditions. Over the last 2 sessions, X’s 5-year risk premium has been marked 192bps wider at 673bps.
"
"No More Fear. After a start to the week that brought moves we had not seen since the since week Brexit came on top in the UK election held last June, the last few days have been far less volatile. Credit indices were effectively stuck in a fairly narrow range (66bps-68bps for iTraxx Main - ITXEB -, 63bps-65bps for CDXIG, 275bps-265bps for Itraxx Crossover). The angst that prevailed before the first round of the French presidential election is now gone. It is best shown by the implied volatility of credit index options which has collapsed since last Friday. While you had to pay 12cts a week ago to buy an option giving you the right to buy ITXEB Series 27 5y at 90bps with a 17th May expiry, 3cts bought you today an option giving you the right to buy it at 75bps this afternoon.
"
"Wearing My Happy Glasses. Volatility has never been so low, and it is difficult to see what might change the situation. That is certainly the feeling most investors have and that is what VIX – an indicator based on the implied volatility of US equity options with a wide range of strikes maturing within 2 months – is telling us. It traded today at levels not seen since before the Great Financial Crisis. There is no stress and it is also obvious from the price action of the credit market, which rallied in a straight line from start to finish. More hedges came off across the board, as the general feeling is that Mrs Le Pen has no chance to come on top next Sunday. Investors have decided to brush aside the uncertainty surrounding the general elections that will take place in France in June and which will effective decide the composition of the government and its political orientation. They have also decided to ignore the tough negotiating stance which was endorsed by the 27 EU members in the talks regarding Brexit with the UK, to which the latter responded by saying it is bracing for a confrontation. Back from a 3-day week-end, they are wearing their happy glasses.

"It Has Been Coming. As recently as 2014, LMETEL ( Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson) was a single A rated company. Today, after a third downgrade in less than 7 months by Moody’s, the rating agency sent it back into junk category for the first time since late 2005. Moody’s statement cited provisions and restructuring charges announced in March as the reasons why LMETEL’s credit metrics will “no longer be commensurate with investment grade rating” and added that “a strategy premised primarily on cost-cutting is not sustainable over the long run”. The management of the company has acknowledged the difficulties they are facing and they vowed to cut costs and get rid of more than $1bln of unprofitable contracts while maintaining necessary investments to prepare for the coming roll-out of the next generation of mobile networks. With the release of the Q1 results, these issues have been well flagged , and the rating announcement did not completely come out of the blue. That is why, even though LMETEL’s 5-year risk premium was marked wider during the session (+5bps at 122bps), it did not blow out. That said, since the 20th March, it has widened by 16bps while iTraxx Main has tightened by 12bps – it closed at 65bps tonight -.
"
"Domino Effect. As expected, the FED left interest rates unchanged yesterday. There was no real surprise in the FOMC statement, but there was just about enough for the market to ramp up the odds for another tightening next month – the probability of a hike in June now stands at 90% -. With unemployment rate at 4.5% and inflation close to 2%, the objectives of the FED are met, and there is not much standing in the way of additional tightening in the coming months. Investors, who have flocked to buy Emerging market sovereign debts because these bonds were, until recently, the only ones still offering some yield, sensed that there might be sooner rather than later safer alternatives to park their cash. In anticipation of outflows from emerging debts which will inevitably result in FX swings and mechanically inflate the debt of emerging countries, the risk premia of emerging sovereigns were marked wider across the board today, while the risk premia of European countries traded tighter as the threat to the euro caused by Mrs Le Pen is fading fast after a shambolic appearance on French TV yesterday night. 
"
"Oil's Tumble. In January, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was trading at $56/barrel after OPEC curbs drove oil to its highest level in two years. But it looks as if the concerted efforts of the group to cut production is failing to clear a surplus of crude. Indeed, lured by rising prices, US shale drillers have been adding rigs every week recently and have pushed US oil production to its highest since August 2015. Libya – which is not an OPEC member - also announced that their production reached its highest since 2014. At the same time, US gasoline demand is pretty weak – in April it was down 2.7% from the same period a year earlier – and investors fear tighter credit conditions in China could depress growth in the coming months. Doubts over the ability of OPEC to durably influence prices are rising fast, and WTI has been on a downward trajectory over the last three. The pace accelerated yesterday with a 5% loss in a single session to $45.5. Even if the level of crude stabilised today, this was enough to spook investors, and they remarked the risk premium of the whole energy complex. This was true on both sides of the Atlantic, but US names were the most affected as a number of them are high beta credits.
"
"Flat. Today was a classic example of “buy the rumour, sell the fact”. The market initially greeted the election of Mr Macron by opening iTraxx Main (ITXEB) a couple of bps tighter - it traded down to 61.5bps -, but it ran into a decent amount of profit taking across all European indices. To be fair, this phenomenon was not limited to credit, and most risky assets felt a bit soft in the afternoon. Eurostoxx traded off its highs, as did the Euro and peripheral rates, particularly BTP-Bund which closed the day 7bps wider on the back of early election noise. iTraxx Financials Senior still managed to slightly outperformed other indices – it closed 1bp tighter at 67bps while ITXEB closed unchanged at 63bps – and that was enough to confirm the outperformance of the European investment universe compared to its US equivalent. ITXEB has now closed the gap with CDX IG. While ITXEB was 10bps wider in early April, both credit indices closed at 63bps tonight.
"
"Is Volatility A Thing Of The Past?. Most of the political risk is behind us in Europe. Unless his party shows very poorly during the general election next month, Mr Macron should be in a position to at least form a coalition with the center right. In the UK, there seems to be little doubt that the Conservative will secure a strong majority in Parliament in a few weeks. In Germany, whoever comes on top in the September ballot will be a member of the current ruling coalition. So the main source of uncertainty is Italy where the 5-star movement and its anti-euro stance is leading the poll, but elections should not be held this year. We know that they will take place before May 2018, but their exact date has not been set. With talks around the restructuring of the Greek debt apparently making progress, the euro area should enjoy a period respite. That is the message sent to the market by investors who are selling options, betting on a very low realized volatility up to the September expiry. The implied volatility of options with a strike 10% out of the money are trading sub 40% on all indices for the next 5 expiries.

"ClippingTheir Wings. The last time we heard about NOBLSP ( Noble Group Limited ) was in February when the company announced they were in discussions with a potential strategic investor, which people identified as China’s state owned Sinochem Group. With Singapore enjoying a bank holiday, few were expecting a profit warning from the commodity trader ahead of their results which should be published tomorrow. Because of wrong way bets on coal prices, NOBLSP predicted a first-quarter loss of roughly $130mln. A profit warning is never good news, but analysts considered it particularly bad in the context of the group reduced scope and scale following their recent disposals. On top on that, the embattled firm did not renew a $615mln credit line that was due to mature this week. It will eat into their liquidity pool and people fear it will hamper their trading capabilities and clip the wings of their traders. While we will have to wait until the equity market comes back from its day off tomorrow to see how the stock react, NOBLSP’s 5-year risk premium was marked 5.5 points upfront wider. Its 5-year default probability jumped 7pts higher to 43%.
"
"Road To Hell. HTZ’s ( The Hertz Corporation ) bonds have been among the worst performers in the US High Yield universe in 2017. At the beginning of the week, the company reported numbers that significantly missed numbers analysts’ expectation and failed to provide formal guidance for the full year or even Q2 after underperforming peer CAR ( Avis Budget Group Inc ) in Q1. HTZ has embarked into an aggressive fleet upgrading, selling off their compact cars and family sedans which are out of favour in the US and stocking up on new models. In a challenging environment - according to the most recent industry data, rental pricing per day keep falling in the US and overseas thanks to overheated competition -, the strategy is a gamble and investors are on the edge. They punished the lack of clarity by sending HTZ’s 5-year risk premium soaring. The 5-year default probability now stands at 63%, the highest it has been over the last eight years.
"
"The Week That Was. It is a week now that French people elected Mr Macron as president, and the pace of risk premia tightening has slowed quiet dramatically. They effectively kept grinding tighter until Wednesday, before consolidating a bit to finish unchanged on the week. iTraxx Main (ITXEB) and CDX IG closed at 63bps, iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) at 256bps, and CDX HY at 328bps. Compared with the dramatic moves which followed the results of the first round of the French presidential election which sent ITXEB 11bps tighter and ITXEX 35bps tighter, the market felt pretty dull. It traded sideways in average volumes, as if investors had already done their business over the last couple of weeks. Many also decided to protect themselves against the most adverse outcomes using options they bought in March and early April, which on the 24th April were left so far out of the money that they did not require a lot of rehedging. 
"
"Retail Hurts. Most of the earning season is now behind us on both side of the Atlantic. In the US, more than 90% of the S&P; companies have now reported their Q1 results It has been a bright reporting season so far with 75% of companies beating analysts’ mean EPS estimates and 64% beating the mean sales estimate. The retail sector has not fared that well though. When most US retailers reported last week – a few are stll due like GPS ( Gap Inc ) on Thursday -, they all appear to suffer one way or another from slower foot traffic on online shopping. Over the last 5 trading sessions, in an otherwise fairly stable credit market - CDXIG is 1bp tighter at 62bps and CDX HY 5bps tighter at 324bps -, they have been the worst performing group and all without exception saw their risk premium increase. To name a few, M’s ( Macy’s Inc ) 5-year CDS traded 42.5bps wider at 272.5bps, JCP’s (J C Penney Company, Inc) 109bps wider at 880bps, JWN’s (Nordstrom, Inc) 19.5bps wider at 163.5bps, KSS’s (Kohl’s Corporation) 11bps wider at 238bps and GPS’s 11.5wider at 272.5bps.
"
"The Yield Rush. The primary market is in full swing at the moment. Every single issuer you can think of is tapping the market, and tries to lock interest rates at current low levels. Sovereigns and corporates, investment grade, cross over and high yield companies… everyone is joining the party. At the safest end, France and the UK issued long dated bonds trying to lure investors with the extra yield offered by their 30y and 40y bonds. Ah the riskiest end, RALFP ( Rallye SA ) issued a 5.5y bond trying to lure investors with the extra yield of a non-rated company. In every case, the result was an overwhelming demand. The UK and France were said to have drawn demand of more than GPB26Bln and €31Bln respectively for their deals, which were subsequently upsized to GBP5Bln and €7Bln. RALFP attracted more than €2.4Bln during the book building process of its €350m deal. It enabled the company to reduce the coupon from an initial 5% indication to the final 4.375% pricing. The original yield whisper led investors to push RALFP’s 5-year risk premium 37bps yesterday. Today, the actual pricing send it another 57bps tighter at 605bps. It has never been so cheap to buy insurance against a default of RALFP over the last 18 months. 
"
"Roll In May?. The happy few who can afford the subscription to DTCC’s “live” volumes statistics – they are now made available to the general public with a 4 week-time lag – will have noticed that almost the whole short risk position held by buy side institutions consists in purchases of iTraxx Crossover Series 26 – on which clients hold $3.5Bln of protection – while these same clients are slightly long risk on iTraxx Crossover Series 27. They have not rolled their hedges into the most recent series. That goes a long way in explaining why the basis of the series 27 is not meaningfully more positive than the basis of other series. Expressed in bps – i.e. adjusted to factor the difference in maturities -, the basis of iTraxx Crossover series 27 barely trades at the same levels as the bases of the older series 26 and 25.  If iTraxx Crossover still appear to be the hedging instrument of choice, the roll process which was initiated on the 20th March is far from over and one should probably expect some action on that front in the not too distant future.
"
"Impeachment . Just when we thought political risk was off the agenda with the French presidential election behind us, Mrs Merkel coming on top in recent regional polls and the result of the UK general election a foregone conclusion, it is back with a vengeance. “Impeachment” was very much the word of the day. In the US, it all started with reports that Mr Trump had potentially interfered with an FBI investigation based on a memo written by the recently sacked FBI director James Corney back in February. It comes when the Trump administration has already to deal with the issue of revealing potentially sensitive information to the Russian ambassador, and also the alledged interference by Russia in the US election campaign. The debate in the press and in markets is whether there is an obstruction of justice and investors’ reaction was to take chips off the table, sending CDXIG to 67bps intraday – it closed tonight at 65bps -, almost 7bps off its recent tights at the beginning of the week. Brazil was also plunged back into a political crisis. One of the largest Brazilian newspapers reported yesterday that President Tremer could be embroiled in a cover-up scheme involving Eduardo Cunha, the former speaker of the lower house now in jail and one of the mastermind behind the impeachment of Dilma Roussef, and could have requested payments to obtain the silence of the ex-deputy. Investors fear that this new crisis could impact the government’s reform agenda which propped up equity gains, and they sent the Bovespa Index into free fall. While Brazilian stocks opened down more than 10%, Brazil’s 5-year risk premium soared 69bps to 270bps.
"
"Nothing Sticks. The last couple of sessions had brought some hope among the most uncivilized market participants that maybe there could be a period of volatility ahead of us. It seemed for a while that political uncertainty could eventually have the better of investors nerves. But that was just that: hope. It appears that nothing can stick on the market at the moment, and whatever concerns people had regarding emerging markets or the stability of the Trump administration were swiftly brushed aside. Equities were back on the front foot across the board, and credit markets resumed their march tighter, once again closing in on the tightest levels of the current series. The brief spell of flat(tish) basis - difference between the fair value of an index and its theoretical value derived from its constituents - for CDX IG, which is usually a sign of stress in the market – it typically materialises when investors reach for the most liquid instruments to hedge their portfolio and buy credit index protection -, appear to be over for now.

"When McDo Meets Specialty Chemicals. The company that produced the iconic foam clamshells that housed McDonald’s Big Macs and kept them warm could soon be based in Switzerland. After the mergers of Dow and DuPont, of Syngenta and ChemChina, and of Monsanto and Bayer, CLAR ( Clariant AG ) announced today a merger of equals with the Huntsman Corporation (it is not part of the 1000 most liquid entities in CDS and does not appear in Datagrapple). The all-stock operation will create a chemical giant worth round $14Bln, with corporate headquarters in Pratteln, Switzerland and operational headquarters in the US. In the recent past, both companies have struggled to bolster their revenues and they said the deal would result in cost savings of about $400mln a year, which the pair valued at $3.5Bln upfront. Investors took a more cautious approach and after an initial 10% jump, both stocks closed the day more or less flat. CLAR, which enters the tie-up with a stronger balance sheet (it has $1.5Bln debt vs Huntsman $3.8Bln), is willing to put at risk its investment grade rating (currently standing at BBB-) to gain access to the US market and of course to share a big cost cutting opportunity. Investors acknowledged the risk of merging with a far more leveraged entity, but only sent CLAR’s 5-year risk premium 6bps wider to 84bps. As part of the merger, the companies plan to IPO Venator, Huntsman’s Pigments and Additive business. Together with the expected synergies, it will certainly improve the credit metrics on the resulting entity.
"
"Scrutinizing Leverage. The dramatic events that took place yesterday night in Manchester had no bearing on the market this morning. Credit indices opened unchanged across the board and trended tighter – albeit very modestly – throughout the session. Interest rates, currencies and commodities were stable and cues were taken from companies’ results, which were mostly on the bright side, particularly as far as iTraxx Crossover constituents were concerned. Investors welcome the deleveraging efforts of CAREUK (Care UK Health and Social Care Plc), which serves patient in the UK and announced a net leverage decrease to 6.14x from 6.86x at the end of the previous quarter, and of GFKLDE (Garkunkel) – the debt collector -, which lowered its net leverage by 0.2 turns compared with last quarter at 4.7x. CAREUK was rewarded with a 55bps tightening of its 5-year risk premium to 406bps, while GFKLDE saw its 5-year risk premium tighten by 25bps at 506bps.
"
"Who Shall Come Next?. FIAT ( Fiat Chrysler Automobiles ) were slapped with a Department of Justice civil lawsuit last night. After VW ( Volkswagen AG ), the Italian carmaker is on the US administration hit list. It is a consequence of the claim made in January by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that the company had equipped Ram pickup trucks and Jeep Grand Cherokee sold from 2014 through 2016 with defeat devices aimed at cheating emission tests. If US officials view the FIAT matter as less serious than VW’s, the maximum EPA fine – which exclude recall costs and any customer compensation- could be $4.6Bln. Filing the suit is seen as an effort to accelerate settlement negotiations, which are now the only way for FCA to avoid a suit the outcome of which is uncertain. Using VW’s fine as a yardstick, they could end up taking a $1.6Bln hit. Their case is allegedly less serious, but considering that FCA’s net debt at the end of 2016 stood at $4.6Bln, this could be significant. Investors reacted late yesterday and marked FCA’s 5-year risk premium 13bps wider to 318bps. They pushed it another 10bps wider this morning, but there was no follow through, and it eventually closed unchanged on the day. The recent wides are proving tough to break in the current positive environment.
"
"Equatorial Guinea Is Not Enough. Part of continental Europe was closed today and it had a bearing on the market activity, and volumes were on the low side. People spent the whole day keeping an eye on headlines regarding the meeting of OPEC and their allies in Vienna. Hardly anything filtered until the middle of the afternoon when the producer group together with Russia and other non-members announced they had agreed to prolong their previous agreement to limit output for another 9 months. While 6 months ago, the cartel surprised investors and delivered cuts that exceeded expectations, the market did not seem entirely convinced today. People were apparently left a bit disappointed and news that Equatorial Guinea was officially becoming the 14th member of OPEC – it will be one of the smallest producers, pumping 270,000 barrels a day – was not the extra something people had been hoping for. Without a steer on what will happen beyond March, there is concern that OPEC could return to the free-for-all production that caused the free fall of oil between mid-2014 and early 2016. While oil had been stable for most of the day, it lost roughly 4% during the last couple of hours of trading. That was a drag on all commodity names, which today formed the worst performing group in the US high yield universe.
"
"Nothing Separates Them. It is a Friday. Large parts of Europe were basking in the sun yesterday enjoying a day off, something that eventually appeared to stretch into today as many people did not bother to come in the office. The UK (Spring bank holiday) and the US (Memorial Day) will be off on Monday. That could only mean one thing: a subdued trading session. That is exactly what we got. It was slow, with very little volatility. In that respect, it mirrored the credit market’s behavior since the beginning of the week and effectively since the beginning of the month. It felt firm and outperformed equity markets. The outperformance of iTraxx Main compared with CDX IG is the other takeaway from May so far. The European investment grade benchmark has closed the gap with its US equivalent and it is quite remarkable that the 2 indices have closed at the same level – give or take 0.25bps – each day of the past fortnight.
"
"Will Italian Join The Party?. After the US and the UK enjoyed a 3 day week-end, Italian election anticipation was the main story to disturb the quiet. From being an outside chance until last week, the possibility of snap elections in Italy in the Autumn has gathered pace, first with talks of an agreement between Renzi and Berlusconi last week, then more surprisingly, over the week-end, with the support from Grillo on a so called “German style proportional representation electoral law”. They seem close to an accord on a voting system where parties securing 5% or more of the votes would be guaranteed to win some seats. A deal is not yet finalized, but these three have an overwhelming majority in parliament and can impose an agreement. If the voting system can be approved in the next few weeks - and a draft budget for 2018 agreed upon before the elections are called -, Italians could be asked to go to the polling stations roughly at the same time as Germans, towards the end of September 2017. Among the possible outcomes, a grand coalition between Renzi’s PD and the center right appear likely, but a hung parliament potentially leading to new elections is a distinct possibility. Investors started to price some of this uncertainty and sent the whole Italian banking complex wider (the 5-year risk premium of the senior debt of Mediobanca was 11.5bps wider at 159bps, Intesa +10bps @ 129.5bps, Unicredit +8bps @ 142bps), which in turn dragged European financials 3bps wider on average at 66.5bps.
"
"Brutally Slow. Greece allegedly threatened to opt out of their next payment without a deal with their creditors. Renzi and Grillo agreed to call for early elections in Italy. Labour are closing the gap with the Conservatives in the general election taking place in the UK next week. Bank Of America and JPMorgan gave revenue updates which pointed towards decline in second-quarter trading revenues of at least 10%. Oil dropped another 3% as questions keep being asked regarding the effectiveness of the OPEC measures to reduce stockpiles around the world. Investors could have plenty of reasons to be cautious going into next month and take chips off the table.  We saw none of that in the credit market today, and, if credit indices have stopped tightening, their risk premia are not widening. They have been stuck in a very narrow range – over the last week, the pick to trough variation of iTraxx Main and CDXIG is less than 1bp and the pick to trough variation of iTraxx Crossover and CDXHY is less than 5bps -. The typically thin liquidity of a shortened week has not been used to push them around.
"
"Stena: The Ebb And Flow. The risk premium of STENA has experienced a rollercoaster ride since the beginning of the week. The origin of most of the moves were to be found in the Drilling unit. The company started by reporting better than expected results for Q1 2017, which were mainly supported by cost savings in the Drilling unit, from the “Cost Race” program, offsetting revenue pressure in this segment resulting from reduced contract coverage. STENA’s 5-year risk premium tightened 26bps to 675bps on Tuesday. Yesterday, oil fell 3%. But, if a lower oil price environment stands to be favorable for shippers like CMA (CMA CGM), it is negative for STENA, giving its significant drilling exposure. STENA’s 5-year risk premium bounced 18bps wider to 693bps. Today, the Drilling unit announced they notified Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI), the Korean shipbuilder, that they have exercised their right to cancel the contract for the construction of “Stena MidMAX”, a dynamically positioned harsh environment semisubmersible drilling unit. SHI has been unable to deliver the rig which was ordered 4 years ago with an expected delivery date in March 2016. The terms of the contract should entitle STENA to the reimbursement of $215mln already paid in pre-delivery installments. So far analysts had been unsure whether STENA would have to take delivery of the vessel, and investors reacted by sending STENA’s 5-year risk premium 35bps tighter to 658bps.
"
"Unpopular. What made Banco Popular Espanol so unpopular? “Real estate” is the short answer. Its balance sheet is still laden with toxic property assets. The bank has already been forced to raise new capital from shareholders three times in the last five years, and in April it said it would need to raise more or consider a corporate transaction. The admission caused turmoil in Spain’s banking industry, which wants to think its real estate woes are a thing of the past. So even though Popular is not a member of any credit index, it has been one of the main drivers of the price action of iTraxx Financials Senior and Subordinated indices over the last few weeks, since the French presidential election is out of the way. With Italian financial institutions which suffered this week from the prospect of general elections held early in September, Spanish banks have massively underperformed the rest of the market. Their poor price action explains the divergence of iTraxx Financials Senior (ITXES) and iTraxx Main (ITXEB). The spread between the 2 indices have gone from as tight as 3bps three weeks ago to more than 8bps – ITXES and ITXEB closed at 70.25bps and 61.5bps respectively - at the close tonight.
"
"Refinancing?. It was a quiet session with most of Europe out for Whit Monday. Volumes were muted, and most credits traded sideways. The main move came from MTNLN (Matalan Finance Plc). The company released their results for the full year 2017, which came at the top end of previous guidance. In the fourth quarter, sales rose 1% to £242mln, gross profits were up 13% to £19mln and EBITDA was up 11% to £10mln. The group reported full price sales growth of 7.5% which is explained by improved clothing ranges and better in store experience. The release also mentioned investment in quality and design within the core Good and Better offer. The supply chain issues which triggered MTNLN’s risk premium widening at the end of last year were reported to be fully resolved. But what really drew investors’ attention was the buyback of £12mln of their unsecured bonds. They interpreted it as a signal of a possible refinancing operation, and sent MTNLN’s 5-year risk premium 159bps tighter at 902bps.
"
"Contrasting Fortunes. Yesterday, MTNLN (Matalan Finance Plc) released numbers which were in line with analysts’ expectations and teased investors with some bonds buy-back. The positive sentiment benefitted the whole retail sector to a certain extent, and NEWLOK (New Look Senior Issuer Plc) saw its risk premium tighten roughly 40bps. But the reprieve was short lived and people were brought back to the harsh retailer’s reality when the company reported much weaker than expected fourth quarter results. Like for like sales are still under pressure, the cost base is on the rise on the back of a growing store estate, higher marketing costs and deteriorating operating leverage. NEWLOK, which sells fashion mainly for women and teenage girls, also warned of challenging times ahead as online competition increases and shoppers seek instant gratification, which “challenges (the company) to be even faster in identifying and responding to trends, buying with more conviction and becoming ever more agile”. When the numbers came out in the morning, the 5-year risk premium jumped 8 upfront points to 33pts upfront + 500bps running. In the afternoon, NEWLOK’s management organised a call with analysts which eventually did nothing to alleviate investors’ fear. It resulted in another 7pts widening of the 5-year risk premium, which means an almost certain default within the next 5 years – the default probably stands above 80% over the next 5 years -.
"
"It Works!!. For once, taxpayers’ money will not be tapped for the rescue of a bank. In a deal brokered by the regulators, SANTAN ( Banco Santander SA ) is stepping in to take over stricken rival Banco Popular Espanol. Tier1 notes were converted into stocks and SANTAN bought the whole equity of the company for a token €1. It means that holders of equity and subordinated debt are effectively wiped out, while holders of senior debt are spared. It is also the first time the new Credit Default Swap documentation introduced in 2014 will have the opportunity to prove its worth. Buyers of subordinated protection on Popular under the previous 2003 documentation will not get any compensation. Debt instruments are the only deliverables into that type of contracts and there is no subordinated debt outstanding. It means that Senior bonds, which are now trading close to or above par, will be the cheapest deliverables, making the contracts worthless. Buyers of senior protection under the 2003 documentation will see their contracts cross triggered by the default of the subordinated debt, and will not get any compensation either for the same reason. Buyers of subordinated protection under the 2014 documentation will be able to trigger their contracts under the Government Intervention clause, and will be able to deliver the proceed of their exchanged subordinated bonds, i.e. nothing. They will be compensated in full for the notional they insured. Finally, there should not be a trigger of the senior protection contracts under the 2014 documentation, and their holders will now be insured against the default of SANTAN’s senior debt.

"LBO Fever. JWN (Nordstrom, Inc) is an upscale fashion specialty retailer based in the US. Founded in 1901 as a shoe store in Seattle, it now operates 354 stores in 40 states and also serves customers online. Like all its peers, it has been rocked by sluggish foot traffic in its department stores and the fierce competition from online retailers. But if its first quarter earnings missed analysts’ estimates, JWN is in better shape than many of its rivals. That is probably the reason why members of the founding family embarked on a plan to potentially take the company private. Such a move could help JWN cope with the retail downturn outside of the spotlight, but it would also most certainly mean more – and maybe much more – leverage at the company than is currently the case. No official deal has been made, but, as a precautionary measure, investors send the company 5-year risk premium 84bps wider at 260bps.
"
"She “Chirac-ed” It!. With a result that was unthinkable a few weeks ago, Britain’s general election has inflicted significant damage on the Conservative Party. Far from achieving a landslide or even bolstering her majority, in a move that French people will find reminiscent of Mr Chirac decision to call early elections in 1997, Mrs May has turned a 17-seat advantage in parliament into a 7-seat shortfall. The result is a hung parliament and the Conservatives will need the support of the Democratic Unionists to achieve a majority to pass even the most basic legislation, let alone the complexities of Brexit. The result plunges UK politics into a period of extreme uncertainty, and the Pound dropped almost 2% as soon as exit polls predicted a hung parliament and never really recovered – it ended the session down roughly 1.7% against the USD and the euro -. Meanwhile, credit, after an initial knee jerk reaction wider, took a much more sanguine approach. Without a clear mandate for the Conservatives’ “harder” Brexit, a “softer”Brexit stance could emerge, and credit investors took it as a bullish signal. All indices are now trading at the tightest levels of the last couple of years. iTraxx Main – which is now trading through CDXIG for the first time in 6 months – had not closed below 60bps since July 20th 2015. It ended the session a shade tighter than 59bps.

"Forza Italia. French people gave a landslide majority in Parliament to their newly elected President. Based on the results of the first round, Mr Macron’s party, La République En Marche, should have around 70% of the seats. But the election results investors paid much attention to were actually the results of the Italian local elections, which were also held on Sunday. Italy’s opposition Five Star movement suffered heavy setbacks, failing to make it into the second round of voting in big cities such as Genoa, Palermo, Parma and Verona. Speculations over the last couple of weeks that Italy was headed towards general elections as early as September pushed the country’s 5-year risk premium up, as the prospect of a non-market-friendly outcome put investors off. But the fact that a multi-party deal on a new electoral law unraveled last week and made it highly unlikely that a snap national vote will be held this year was compounded by the week-end results which dimmed Five Star’s prospects of leading the national government after parliamentary elections. Investors cheered by sending Italy’s 5-year risk premium 5bps tighter to 158bps, almost back to the tightest levels of the year.

"No News… Just No Buyers. When technology shares sold off at the very end of last week, credit indices hardly reacted. And for a reason: they do not include any of the Apple, Alphabet, Facebook or Google of this world. Credit investors focused instead on reassuring macro news regarding the cohesion of the European Union and sent indices tighter across the board. In the absence of specific news today, the rebound in tech stocks could hardly be used as an excuse to justify the additional index tightening. There were simply no marginal buyers of index protection. Every time people came to get rid of hedges that do not seem to bring value any more – what is the point of paying carry in a market which has moved in a straight line over the last 7 weeks from 77bps to 57bps for iTraxx Main and from 69bps to 59bps on CDX IG -, no one was willing to step up and catch a falling knife. Except for a handful of names – almost all belonging to the energy and retail sectors -, people are not buying protection on single references either, so arbitragers are unlikely to bring any support to index protection. That rally might have more legs.
"
"Signs Of Stress Under The Surface. At the moment, if you look at credit indices, they appear rock solid. The march tighter of their risk premia has seemed unstoppable since the first round of the French presidential election 6 weeks ago. In Europe, iTraxx Main and iTraxx Crossover went from 77bps to 56.5bps and from 301bps to 235bps respectively. In the US, CDX IG went from 69bps to 59bps. CDX HY was the odd one out and only tightened 4bps from 329bps to 325bps. None of the constituents of this index have been stable though. Most have followed the same pattern as the rest of the market and saw their risk premia tighten meaningfully, while some – roughly the energy sector and the consumers cyclical – experienced some very tough times. On average, the risk premium of High Yield energy names in the US blew up 8%, from 374bps to 405bps, while the risk premium of High Yield financial names shrunk 7%, from 300bps to 279bps. Despite the globally positive environment, signs of stress are appearing in some compartments of the market, and it will be interesting to keep an eye on the energy sector, especially if oil keeps falling at the same pace as recently – it dropped 15% over the last few weeks and is back to its lowest level of the year -.

"Food Deflation . When the company reported its first quarter results today, KR ( Kroger Co ) matched analysts’ expectations in terms of earnings. They even slightly beat revenue forecasts. But investors rewarded them by sending the shares almost 20% down and the company’s 5-year risk premium 12bps wider at 84bps, as KR also cut their full year EPS guidance 10%, from between $2.21 and $2.25 per share to between $2 and $2.05 per share. In recent times, lower food prices have brought headaches to grocery stores. In order to boost customer traffic, they had to regularly offer steep discounts. While a boon for consumers, price wars have weighted on profit margins. And competition is actually about to get fiercer when the German discount chain Lidl will open its first US stores in the next coming days. Famous in Europe for their own label products, they are about to take the fight to the US. A tough trade will only get tougher.

"My 670HP Case Tractor is an IG. 
  CNH was rewarded today for its good management over the recent years. 
  Sandard Poor’s upgraded  CNH (CNH Industrial NV) from BB+ to BBB-. 
  The rating agency is rewarding a conservative financial policy despite a challenging operating environment. 
  The agency is the first to upgrade CNH to an investment grade (IG)  rating. The CDS market reacted sharply. 
  The CDS traded down to 87bps from 140bps at yesterday close. 
   CNH is the spin-off of Fiat’s capital goods activities in 2011. CNH stands for Case New Holland. 
   CNH main business is the agricultural and construction equipment. 
   Its main competitors are DE (Deere & Company) and CAT 
   (Caterpillar Inc.) which CDS are respectively trading at 28bps and 38bps. 
   The financial cost of CNH will be closer to its competitors. 
   Next year, CNH has 2B€ out of an 8B€ bond program to refinance. Being an IG issuer will make a difference.  

CNH CDS tightening raises again the  dispersion within the European high yield market.  Over the last most, credit positive stories are
 going along with  very concerning credit stories.

"A Tricky Task Just Got More Difficult. On Friday, it emerged that Fortress Investment Group and Elliott Capital Management had dropped out of talks to buy bad loans from MONTE ( Banca Monte dei Paschi  ) complicating the rescue plan for the lender backed by the Italian government. They were the only international bidders for the riskier tranches of MONTE’s bad loan securitization. That leaves Atlante, the fund set up to help the struggling Italian banking sector, as the only potential buyer and jeopardizes the asset sale, which is a key part of the plan to restructure the bank with a capital injection from the state, after MONTE failed to shore up capital privately. Ultimately, it could also make similar rescue plans for two other northern Italian lenders, Veneto Banca Spa and Popolare Vicenza Spa, much more difficult to pull off. Surprisingly, if MONTE’s 5-year risk premium was marked aggressively wider - insuring senior debt now costs 330bps per year, while insuring subordinated costs 73.5% upfront -, it did not feed through the whole Italian banking sector and most names were actually unchanged to a tad tighter.
"
"European Retailers Go Shopping. Together with their new bond issue at the end of May, COFP ( Casino Guichard Perrachon SA ) announced they were redeeming some of their existing debt. Yesterday, TSCO ( Tesco Plc ) followed suit and surprised the market by announcing a tender offer of some of its outstanding GBP, EUR and USD bonds. The buyback will amount to a maximum of GBP500mln and cover bonds maturing between 2029 and 2057, even though the main targets are TSCO’s $300mln 6.15% bond due in 2037 and their €600mln 5.125% bond due in 2047. Combined with GBP1.7Bln of bonds maturing in 2017, the gross debt reduction could amount to more than GBP2Bln for the fiscal year 2017/2018, and would add to the GBP1.5Bln cut achieved in 2016/2015. Since the tender announcement, TSCO’s euro denominated 2047 bond has tightened by roughly 30bps. It mechanically compressed yields of other maturities, and TSCO’s 5-year risk premium tightened by 13bps to 148bps tonight. It benefitted the whole sector in Europe, which, far from suffering from the Amazon effect which has rocked US retailers, trades at its tightest level of the year
"
"Mind The (Growing) Gap. General market sentiment softened yesterday as oil prices took a leg lower, taking them into bear market territory : WTI is down more than 20% from its January high. Oversupply fears continue to linger. They stem from US shale, but also from rising production in Nigeria and Libya, two OPEC countries that are exempt from the production cut agreement. That weighted on the energy heavy US indices, which, after an indifferent start to the session, started to move wider as soon as oil proved unable to stabilise. CDX IG closed 1bp wider at 62bps. At the same time, European indices benefitted from the news that ISPIM ( Intesa Sanpaolo SpA ) came forward with an offer to take on the assets of the two troubled banks in Italy’s Veneto region on condition that it does not have to pay more than a token price and that the deal does not harm its own capital and dividends. The news gave a boost to the financial sector which outperformed the rest of the market and allowed iTraxx Main (ITXEB) to tighten on the day by 1bp to 55bps. The differential between ITXEB and CDXIG now stands at 7bps, the widest it has been since the last energy crisis at the beginning of 2016.
"
"Rules Are Changing. “Following consultation with markets participants and the iTraxx Europe Advisory Committee, HIS Markit has decided that, subject to changes to market infrastructure (in particular clearing) being implemented in time, Itraxx Europe Series 28 will be issued in September 2017 under revised index rules. UK and Swiss banks will be included in the new index Series at HoldCo Level for the Senior and Subordinated Financial Indices.” The above press release by Markit triggered a massive reaction on UK and Swiss banks CDS which currently reference bank operating companies. Investors anticipated that the liquidity of OpCo contracts will be hampered going forward, and, despite that, except for CS ( Credit Suisse Group AG ) - an entity for which CDS already reference the HoldCo -, CDS referencing banks’ HoldCo are not commonly traded at the moment leaving them without any alternative hedge, they decided to dump protection aggressively. CDS referencing the OpCo of Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, RBS, Standard Chartered and UBS were sent 14bps, 9bps, 10bps, 13bps, 14bps and 9bps tighter at 43bps, 30bps, 39bps, 52bps, 49bps and 27bps respectively. iTraxx Financials is now trading roughly flat to iTraxx Main – it was 13bps wider mid April – and iTraxx Main further outperformed CDXIG.
 
"
"Relative Value Opportunity?. We discussed yesterday the move of the cost of insuring debt issued by operating companies of Swiss and UK banks, which collapsed after IHS Markit announced such Credit Default Swaps would not be included in future series of iTraxx indices. The move affected CDS referencing senior and subordinated debts, and investors were already baffled by its magnitude. But it was nothing compared to today’s bloodbath. People sold protection on senior and subordinated debt, as if there were no tomorrow. Swiss and UK names were the most affected, but no name escaped the rage, and every single risk premium in the financial sector, banks and insurers alike, was indicated tighter at the end of the day. What started with a purely technical situation – the risk of illiquidity of some CDS coupled with some orphaning worries – turned into broad-based capitulation for no obvious reason. iTraxx Financials Subordinated, which traded at 155bps a couple of days ago, closed at 124bps tonight, a move only seen in the recent past after the first round of the French presidential election, when investors celebrated the quasi certain win of the most euro friendly candidate. Next week should see plenty of relative value trade ideas put in front of investors by their favourite dealer.
"
"Is It A Game Changer?. Waymo, which is owned by Alphabet Inc., is operating a fleet of autonomous vehicles. Its early rider program is a public trial of its self-driving cars in Phoenix, Arizona. It offers a growing fleet – it should reach 600 vehicles in the near future – of Chrysler Pacifica minivans to volunteer members of the public, willing to use its ride-hailing service. Waymo announced today that it has reached an agreement with CAR ( Avis Budget Group Inc ) to service and store its vehicles. CAR will take care of interior and exterior cleaning, oil changes, tire rotation, spare parts order and maintenance. It will make sure that Waymo’s cars are “ready for (their) riders at any time of the day or the night”. This partnership is the first major one involving oversight of a driverless car fleet. It could help the technology spread, and it could also provide struggling car rental companies, which are trying to reinvent themselves in an ever more competitive environment, with a lifeline. Since the last roll in March, CAR’s 5-year risk premium had been on a widening trend, roughly going from 400bps to 600bps. Today’s 66bps tightening– it closed at 494bps – seems to have broken it. There might be some light at the end of the tunnel for CAR’s credit investors after all.
"
"Self-Driving Cars Are Good For Some, But…. Except CDXHY in the US which benefitted from the strength of oil and finished unchanged, the credit market was weak across the board after Mr Draghi’s change in language. The president of the ECB hinted at tapering for the first time today, and said that “deflationary forces have been replaced by reflationary ones”. The comment took the market slightly off guard mid-morning. SHAEFF ( Schaeffler AG ) also surprised investors and was under pressure long before Mr Draghi’s comments. The German auto-parts maker cut its 2017 profitability forecast, citing price pressure and rising investments to keep up with the industry’s accelerating switch to electronics. The profit warning stoked concerns about parts manufacturers’ ability to support the industry shift to electric, self-driving vehicles that do not require clutches or other transmission parts. The main casualty was SHAEFF’s stock which was marked down almost 15%, but the company’s 5-year risk premium was not spared either and finished the day 6bps wider at 85bps. 
"
"Gamma Or Theta?. In the morning, investors appeared to be reappraising the outlook for global borrowing costs and monetary policy in the wake of the comments from the usually dovish Mr Draghi. Global central bankers are coalescing around the message that the cost of money is headed higher. These concerns about tighter monetary conditions were compounded by remarks by Mrs Yellen yesterday that asset valuations look high by some measures, another global cyber-attack, an IMF cut to their US growth forecast. As a precautionary measure, iTraxx Main (ITXEB) was sent 1.5bps at 56.5bps, iTraxx Crossover was sent 6bps wider at 244bps, and all risky assets felt a bit shaky. That proved too much for the ECB to handle and they felt they had to say markets had misjudged Mr Draghi speech on stimulus. It certainly produced the desired effect, and risky assets went in reverse across the board. So, for the first time in a while, volatility has reared its head again, with investors able to capture a 4bps total variation on ITXEB today. The potential for tape-bombs to rock the market is now clear to everyone. That leaves options players conflicted between owning cheap gamma and having positive theta for the US holiday week-end coming up.
"
"Jumbo Leveraged Deals Are Back. Roughly a year ago, SPLS’s (Staples Inc) attempt to buy ODP (Office Depot Inc) for $6.3Bln was thwarted by antitrust regulators. A tough year ensued after its CEO stepped down, during which the company scrambled for a plan B, closing stores and seeking to recast itself as a source of business services. It looks as if these transformation efforts seduced Sycamore though. They announced yesterday night that they are ready to bid $6.9Bln to buy SPLS in what could be the largest LBO announced this year. Even though a deal had been rumoured for some time – it was reported in May that a takeover offer from Cerberus had been rejected because it was too low -, investors initially sent SPLS’s 5-year risk premium soaring 50bps wider at 350bps, as such deals inevitably mean more debt. But soon it transpired that Sycamore, in a similar move to what it did when it bought Jones Group in 2014 and split it in 4 different independent operating companies, could divide SPLS into three different entities: US retail, Canadian retail and corporate-supply business. It inevitably raised the question of where the debt will sit and which entity (or entities) CDS currently referencing SPLS will cover. The answer is not necessarily the most leveraged. The CDS gave up all its widening and more, to close 25bps tighter on the day at 272bps. 
"
"Banks! … Again!. While volatility made a timid come-back this week in the credit market, it was nothing compared with what experienced interest rates. As far as credit is concerned, the main take-away of the week is once again the outperformance of the financial sector compared with the rest of the market. And once again, they benefitted from a “technical” tailwind. Last week it was the change of inclusion rules in the iTraxx Financials index - going forward it will reference bank Holdco rather than Opco to better reflect the capital structure – that gave UK and Swiss banks a boost. This time it came from articles in the press suggesting that the Italian government would be fast tracking the Non-Preferred Seniority (NPS) into the creditor hierarchy via legislation, potentially as early as July. Such type of debt ranks lower than senior debt. Thus, when it is issued, it makes senior debt even more protected. Furthermore, if the example of French banks – which can already issue such NPS debt – is any guide, it will mean that the issuance of senior debt will drop significantly, substantially impacting hedging needs. In the above uniformly pale grapple, only 3 bright green boxes stand out : they correspond to ISPIM ( Intesa Sanpaolo SpA ), UCGIM ( UniCredit SpA  ) and BACRED ( Mediobanca  ). Over the week, these three banks saw their risk premia tighten respectively by 13bps (at 89bps), 17bps (at 90.5bps) and 25bps (at 102.5bps).
"
"The Calm Before The Primary Storm?. In the credit market, primary will most likely be the focus in the near future with some supply expected to come across the spectrum of ratings. Very thinly staffed trading desks and worries around rates could make the hurdle for these deals relatively high though, particularly in high yield. But if we experience a few days of stability, then the market should be able to turn the corner of the recent buyers’ strike that was to be expected on a day where volumes were best described as anaemic ahead of the 4th July. Indeed, the market is seemingly experiencing endless amount of inflows, and most people expect the current low default environment to persist throughout 2017. 
"
"The Rumour Has It. When they came in the office this morning, European investors were not expecting any excitement. And that is exactly what they got for the most part. There were pockets of activity though. One related to rumours of a merger between GASSM ( Gas Natural SDG SA ) and ELEPOR ( EDP - Energias De Portugal SA ). According to press reports, the Spanish power and gas distributor would have approached its Portuguese rival with a view to form the fourth-biggest utility by market value. Recently, the market has been rife with consolidation rumours in the sector. Just a few months ago, ELEPOR was said to be exploring a sale of Naturgas, its Spanish gas distributor. Even if ELEPOR rebuffed the merger talks, investors appeared to give some credit to the story, and the risk premia of the two companies compressed. While ELEPOR’s 5-year CDS traded 14bps tighter at 102bps, GASSM’s traded 3.5bps wider at 60.5bps. They were respectively the best and worst performers of the day among utilities
"
"Summer Lull Already?. After last week sell-off in rates, central banks have learnt their lesson and speeches delivered over the last few days have left no room for ambiguity. ECB’s board member Praet preached for patience at the central bank, insisting that inflation still needs “more time to show through convincingly in the data”. And fellow board member Notowny said that the ECB should “normalize as soon as the economy allows” but that at the same time he “expects a long period of low rates”. At the same time, geopolitical worries are back, and the confirmation that North Korea had fired an intercontinental ballistic missile yesterday marked a new escalation in the country’s stand-off with the US. These counteracting forces have kept volatility to a minimum in the credit space over the last days. Today’s session certainly had a summer lull feeling about it, but the current equilibrium could be more fragile than it seems.
"
"Did They Top The Market?. In June this year, Argentina became the third Latin American issuer to sell century bonds. Mexico was the first in 2010, followed by Petrobras – the first non-investment grade issuer – in 2015. Since his election in December 2015, President Macri had been a darling of emerging-market investors, promising to ignite the economy, tame inflation and roll back regulations that impeded businesses. It culminated 3 weeks ago, on June 19th, with the sale of $2.75Bln of bonds maturing in 2117. The next day, MSCI surprised analysts when they announced they would not raise Argentina to emerging-market status because they were not convinced that economic changes under Macri were irreversible. Instead, they left it at the “frontier” level with the likes of Mauritius, Sri Lanka and Kazakhstan. Since then, Argentina has been one of the worst performers in emerging markets and the volatility of the peso led even forced Pampa Energia – one of Argentina’s biggest energy companies - to scrap an overseas bond sale last week. To make matters worse, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, the former president who is deeply unpopular with investors, could make a political comeback as she runs for a seat in the senate. After touching a low of 315bps in June, the 5-year risk premium of Argentina is on the rise again. It closed tonight at 349bps, 17bps wider on the day.
"
"Credit Cannot Widen, Can It?. It was another fairly weak and lacklustre session. Credit indices were pushed wider in the morning as investors were still digesting the sale-off in rates yesterday which took 10-year rates at their highest in 18 months in Europe. But it never felt that the market was about to melt, and no one rushed to add hedges to the downside. Quite the opposite happened actually. Most people looked at it as an opportunity to “buy the dip”. It was obvious in the option market. Hardly anyone was buying payers - which give you the right to purchase protection - and enquiries received by dealers came from investors asking to buy receivers – which give you the right to sell protection – across August, September and October expiry, with the 52.5 and 55bps strikes very popular for iTraxx Main. Market participants feel very relaxed about any downside at the moment, and they are more worried about a sudden rip tighter in risk premia.
"
"Bad Die Hard Habits. MTNLN (Matalan) released their Q2 trading update this morning. The numbers came in better than expected, but they were certainly not strong enough to warrant a 206bps tightening (or 7 points upfront as this name used to belong to the distress category) to 704bps. Even though management did not discuss refinancing during the call with analysts, a story published by the FT suggested that a group of hedge funds are looking at refinancing options for the company which may lead to orphaning. This group of credit-focused investors would have sold large amounts of Credit Default Swaps referencing Matalan Finance Plc – the entity currently used by Matalan to issue debt – and the certainty that this entity would not default would enable them to reap large profits. They would have offered to fully support any refinancing of MTNLN’s existing debt so long as Matalan issues the new debt out of a new entity. That is the kind of deals that have marred the CDS market in the past and make a mockery of the market place’s efforts towards more transparency. People familiar with the company said its management was unlikely to accept the funds’ plan, let’s hope they are right!
"
"Food Hall Worries. It was another session spent in a very narrow trading range. At the moment, it seems that credit is struggling to rally and struggling to sell-off. The earnings of MARSPE ( Marks and Spencer Group Plc ) provided a bit of excitement though. The company reported first quarter results that got investors worried as they showed a slowdown in food, where growth had been a bright spot over the last few years and whose expansion has compensated for shortcomings in the clothing department. Same-store sales fell 0.1% - the second in succession after last quarter 2.1% decline -, missing analysts’ estimate for a 0.6% gain, as they expected a boost from a late Easter and surging inflation. The company also joined rivals in warning over tough conditions on the high street as it said consumer confidence had taken a turn for the worst in recent weeks. We should get more insight as other retailers will be reporting in the coming days, but MARSPE was the laggard on the consumer cyclical sector. Its 5-year risk premium widened 3.5.bps to 145bps.
"
"Is Daimler Next In Line?. The global credit market cannot widen two weeks in a row and it seems that it needed a couple of strong sessions after a hesitant start to the week. It is a slightly different story as far as European car manufacturers are concerned. They have seen their risk premia steadily increase since the June roll, and investors’ worries with regards to DAIGR ( Daimler AG ) were compounded after press reports said Stuttgart prosecutors were probing the use of so-called defeat devices used to beat emission tests in Europe and in the US… again. It could concern more than a million vehicles sold between 2008 and 2016. Since it was revealed in September 2015 that VW ( Volkswagen AG ) installed software to bypass pollution rules, many car manufacturers have been embroiled in that technology scandal. So far, only FCAIM ( Fiat Chrysler Automobiles ) and VW have suffered regulatory and legal action. And it only happened in the US. With politicians around Europe asking for government action against those who are found to have misled regulators and consumers, investors have left guessing who might be next. While iTraxx Main was 1bp tighter at 54bps – yes, it is back to its tightest levels -, DAIGR’s 5-year risk premium was 1.5bps wider at 49bps.
"
"Head Off for Bastille Day. The over performance of European credit over its US equivalent was heading off its path today. The iTraxx Europe index is closing a touch wider while its US equivalent is closing stronger. The traded volumes reported on the various SDR were very low. The European credit indices coming off into the close was due to the lacklustre activity but it was also due to some iTraxx financial index consolidation. At 50bps, the risk reward on European banks and insurance companies could see more profit taking going forward. However, the single names did not follow through, hardly moving wider.  

The squeeze in CDS can be stopped by the cash supply. The concession to CDS that Hema BV gave today was more than 200bps pushing the CDS 40bps wider. More issuance and refinancing could bring the CDS market more in line with the price of risks. 

"
"New perspective for VUE. The cinema operator VUE was part of the iTraxx Crossover index over the last 3 years from the time it was bought by the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, the Canadian pension fund. It was reported over the weekend that the pension fund is considering a sale or an IPO for VUE. The CDS tightened by 50bps today, closing at 192bps. Even if the company were bought by another private equity fund, the CDS would likely become an orphan as the issuer - VUE INTERNATIONAL BIDCO PLC - would be dissolved. However, the deal is far from being a done deal. Cinema attendance is quiet challenging. The all-time high in the UK was in 1946 with 1,635M admissions. Cinema admissions have been around 170M per year recently. Not all venues will be converted into gamers’ arenas like the one VUE converted in London. At least we know that the Ontario municipal pensioners have little appetite for gamers and that they see limited perspective on the VUE business model transformation.

Meanwhile, the credit market was gently enjoying a quiet session with little activity reported across the board.

"
"Imagine If Stocks Were Up. When volumes are light and volatility is subdued, credit derivatives indices – and all Credit Default Swaps actually – tend to outperform. Indeed, investors hate to pay carry in a zero-interest-rate-no-default-world when there is no marked-to-market to protect. This theme clearly played out today. Despite European equities down roughly 1% and US equities in the red as well, credit indices closed tighter across the board – the odd one out was CDXHY which was 1bp wider at 324bps -. Concerns regarding the lack of progress of the US Republican healthcare bill which does not bode well for Tax or other fiscal reforms gripped stocks, but there was no one - yet - to buy CDS just because stocks were down. Disappointing results from ERICB ( Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson ) – which sent its stock down almost 16% and its 5-year risk premium 12bps wider at 138bps – failed to trigger weakness in the telco sector – or any other sector! – and iTraxx Main protection was sold aggressively as soon as it approached 54bps, as some people are managing gamma negative option positions expiring tomorrow.
"
"Love It Or Hate It. If you ask any credit traders what has been the most salient feature of the market since the beginning of the year, the unanimous answer will be “no volatility”. But while traders are moaning about a market that has not experienced any rough patch in over a year - the most recent credit wobble followed the run up to the French elections and lasted less a week while the previous one goes back to the US elections and lasted a day -, others are relishing this environment. Investment bankers had a very good run advising on mergers and advising on bond and equity sales. And so had wealth management units at the different investment banks. Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan announced record profits from wealth and asset management when they reported earnings during the last week, while they all suffered steep drop in revenue from trading bonds. Today, Morgan Stanley reported earnings that were symptomatic on that trend. Despite a 4% drop in fixed Income revenue, a 29% jump in wealth management profit helped it top estimates. 
"
"It's Thursday, It's Mario Day. People spent the morning waiting for Mr Draghi to speak assuming it would dictate the price action for the rest of the day. During the last couple of weeks, the Bank of Japan intervened in the market to cap yields and Mrs Yellen delivered a dovish testimony which triggered to the latest risky asset. So, unsurprisingly, the ECB president did not deviate much and did not deliver any upset. He said the ECB would take a decision in the autumn on any change in its language on bond purchases. Credit indices hardly moved during the press conference, and the only scare eventually came from the US. News that a probe into Mr Trump’s business transaction with Russian counterparties was extended took a small dent in the market. But, ultimately, neither credit nor equities can be said to have cared hugely about any of this. Valuations are stretched, but that by itself is not going to make the market turn.
"
"They Are On A Roll. Since the beginning of the year, investment grade credits had an impressive run in the US. The risk premium of CDX IG, which references the most liquid US companies, went from 66bps to 57bps, even though its maturity has been extended by 6 months, which the market values currently at 8.5bps. The performance of the average risk premium is effectively 17.5bps, ie more than 25%. But that pales in comparison with the performance of iTraxx Main. The risk premium of the European benchmark went from 69bps to 52bps, going through a maturity extension worth 6.5bps. The tightening is an impressive 23.5bps, ie 34%. The difference between the US and European indices comes mainly from banks which are not included in CDX IG. On average, the 5-year risk premia of European Banks has been halved, trading from 95.5bps to 47.5bps. Among them, the worst performer is HBOS – which only tightened by 28% from 65bps to 46bps – and the bests in class are STANLN, BNP, SANTAN and INTNED – which tightened by roughly 60% to 42bps, 35bps, 47bps and 28bps respectively -. No wonder they seem to have reached some kind of floor.
"
"From Bad To Worse?. The news came out on Friday, but it took the week-end to sink with credit investors. VW ( Volkswagen AG ), DAIGR ( Daimler AG ), and BMW ( Bayerische Motoren Werke AG ) may have colluded for decades to agree on technical standards, thereby impeding competition. German car makers seemed to have just turned the corner after the diesel emissions scandal, but in the process VW annoyed the European Commission. It refused to compensate the more than 8mln European customers affected by its diesel emission cheating, whereas it spent more than $20Bln in the US to atone for its wrongdoing. Anti-competitive practises fall in a completely different category though. And Brussels has plenty of tools to punish guilty parties. While the scope of any wrongdoing and potential fines are still unclear, in theory it can impose penalty of up to 10% of revenues on cartel members. Recently Google was fined €2.4Bln for abusing market dominance, and last year truck-markers had to cough-up €2.9Bln for price fixing. The German trio potentially faces a combined €50Bln bill. In an otherwise unremarkable session, the 3 German car makers were among the 4 worst performers of iTraxx Main constituents. The risk premia of VW, DAIGR and BMW were respectively 10bps (at 70bps), 6bps (at 57bps) and 4.5bps (at 48.5bps) wider.
"
"The End Of Heavy Metal?. The reporting season began a couple of weeks ago, and is now in full swing. Numbers have managed to trigger some price moves, but most were kept in check as surprises have been few and far between. AALLN (Anglo American Plc) will not report before Thursday, but it benefitted today from unexpected good news from one of its subsidiary: Kumba. Kumba is a supplier of high quality iron ore to the global steel industry from its operation in South Africa. It reported its earnings for the first half of 2017, and announced that it will resume paying dividends for the first time since halting payouts in 2015 amid a collapse in ore prices. The 69.7% that AALLN owns in the company will enable it to report $210mln in underlying earnings. It lifted investors’ mood and they sent AALLN’s 5-year risk premium 5bps tighter at 145bps.

"Everybody Thought It Was Done... But It's Not. In still near zero interest rate environment, bankers and their clients have been busy mulling M&A; deals. But if potentially cheap financing is certainly a favorable environment, it does not mean it is available to everyone. Large leveraged buyouts, in which financial sponsors raise a large amount of debt to finance an acquisition, have become increasingly rare since the 2008 financial crisis led to tighter rules on lending at banks. It was announced today that BMC Software Inc ended talks to acquire CA Inc after struggling to obtain bank financing for the deal despite the high free cash-flows CA derives from its mainframe business. With no other credible buyer in sight, it was not very good news for CA's shareholders who the value of the roughly $13bln company plunge roughly 11%. It was a different story for holders of CA's debt. The company's 5-year risk premium jumped almost 200bps back in June when the deal was first rumored. Today, it came half the way back and closed105bps tighter at 148bps.

"When Tobacco Gets Smoked. “The overwhelming amount of death and disease attributable to tobacco is caused by addiction to cigarettes – the only legal consumer product that, when used as intended, will kill half of long term users”, said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb in a statement announcing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration plans to explore regulating the level of nicotine in conventional cigarettes. It could represent one of the most sweeping effort by the federal administration to reduce smoking and it has the potential to reshape the tobacco industry. While the plan to crack down on nicotine levels – the very ingredient that keeps smokers loyal – is bad news for the cigarette business, the impact could be tempered for companies like Philip Morris and MO ( Altria Group Inc ) which have been putting emphasis on innovations they say have less health risk. The two sister companies have been working on iQOS, a device that gives a nicotine hit by heating tobacco instead of burning it. Nevertheless, the initial market reaction was to send tobacco companies’ risk premia wider across the board : Mo’s was 9bps wider at 36bps, BATSLN’s ( Britisn American Tobacco Plc ) was 4bps wider at 56bps and IMBLN’s ( Imperial Brands Plc ). Relative value trades will come later!

"Another Bumpy Ride Ahead?. Late on Friday, HTZ ( The Hertz Corporation ) said that it could not meet all the conditions to redeem some of its 2019 notes and that it has to call off the plan announced un June, when the company sold new bonds to help optimize its capital structure. HTZ has not reported earnings yet – it will do so on the 8th August – and it sparked speculation that quarterly results could be worse than expected. The announcement led investors to suspect that banks are hesitating to refinance the money losing auto renter and want more liquidity preserved. Htz’s 5-year risk premium had a pretty rough ride following the previous set of results back in May, when the company’s 5-year default probability (PD) went from 58% to 68% in a few sessions. Investors could be in for a similar kind of ride. The 5-year PD which stood at 57% last Thursday shot up to 62% at the close.
"
"When Is Far Far Enough?. Credit experienced another positive session today, with all indices trading near the tightest levels of the year – which are effectively the tightest levels of the last 3 years – reached a few sessions ago. The market is benefitting from the light volumes, low volatility environment that investors foresee in August. If such scenario materialises, why would they want to give away some carry and pay for protection. The performance of credit overall was underpinned by the tightening of the miners and basic material sector. BHP Billiton, Mittal, Glencore and Anglo American all saw their 5-year risk premia reach multiyear low after commodity prices continue their surge on optimism the global economy is keeping its momentum. But down at these tighter levels, after what looked like one way traffic over the last 3 months – since early May, Mittal is 120bps tighter at 166bps, Glencore 70bps tighter at 121bps and Anglo 80bps tighter at 119bps - some 2-way flow is developing. While some investors who were holding short risk positions are throwing the towels, others who were riding the tightening wave are taking chips off the table.
"
"It Takes Two To Move It. The sentiment in credit market is still positive across the board. If credit indices are experiencing very little volatility, they are nevertheless managing a slow grind tighter. It comes to a large extend from a single name protection buyers’ strike. There is no immediate risk perceived on the credit quality of most companies. It takes some seriously negative news to impact any risk premium at the moment. Big moves tighter can also trigger a need for consolidation in some cases. And it usually takes a combination of the two for the 5-year CDS of a company to widen meaningfully. Such was the case of VUECIN (Vue International BidCo Plc) today. Its risk premium tightened dramatically a couple of weeks ago, when its owners were rumoured to mull an IPO. During the session, AMC Entertainment, the number 1 movie theatre chain in the US and in the world, pre-announced Q2 results that missed analysts’ estimates by a mile, and predicted a dire third quarter, suggesting that the company is yet to see an end to the disappointment at the box office. AMC has a significant presence in Europe through its London based subsidiary Odeon & UCI Cinemas Group, and this announcement does not bode very well for VUECIN. The latter’s risk premium was sent 19bps wider to 192bps and was the worst performer among the constituents of iTraxx Crossover.
"
"Refinancing? . ASTIM ( Astaldi Spa ) mainly designs, develops and operates public infrastructure and large scale civil engineering works. The company reported yesterday night. From a fundamental credit perspective, the results were a bit of mixed bag, as EBITDA of €113mln was a decent beat compared with analysts’ expectations while net debt was indicated significantly higher. During their conference call, the management also reiterated their full year guidance. But overshadowing everything else, the main takeaway from the results from a trading perspective was the company saying they are continuing to target some refinancing. It could come in the form of a mix of bonds and bank facilities. That point sent ASTIM’s 5-year risk premium almost 100bps to 828bps.
"
"We Love It, They Do Not Like It So Much. Back in January, PSON ( Pearson Plc ) issued a major profit warning that led to its worst ever day on the stock market and one of the toughest its 5-year risk premium has ever experienced in the credit market. There was no such tape-bomb when the company announced its results this morning. They even came slightly ahead of analysts’ expectations, but it offers little insight given the company’s dependence on the all-important October-November trading period and equity investors decided to err on the side of caution. They were also probably a bit disappointed by the confirmation that the interim dividend would be cut 72% to 5p. This is precisely what cheered credit investors up. It confirms the cautious stance the company said it would adopt after the sale of Penguin a month ago to bolster the balance sheet. That approach also materialised in the announcement of the redemption of PSON’s 2018 notes and of a tender to purchase their USD bonds maturing in 2022 and 2023. PSON’s 5-year CDS closed 15bps tighter at 97bps.
"
"M&A Risk? None for Fresenius. The credit market was very quiet during the whole session. Most investors are having a summer nap after the heat wave of positive earnings released in July. Half of the on-the-run credit index members have reported so far. The earnings were positive across the board. The CDS premia could stay tight for some time this month due to the investors’ apathy. We could have expected that some company news could wake up the investors interest. Fresenius Medical Care has announced today that it intends to acquire NxStage Medical, Inc. in cash and debt for 2BUSD. It hardly moved Fresenius SE & Co KGaA CDS – its main shareholder. The CDS is closing unchanged at 56bps. Fresenius will keep being acquisitive over the next 3 years in its strategic initiative. Even if Fresenius credit story is impressive, there is little left for being long risk at this level.

"Why Should I Rent a Van?. When I can just get an all-inclusive  large van delivery service  for just a third of the price. Moving from one place to another in London is a very frequent trouble for young Londoner. With no car in the city, they could eventually rent a van from Avis to move their belongings. But, they have a much better deal in hiring a van with a driver moving everything door to door for just a third of the rental price. Moreover, they do not have to drive on the wrong side of the road as people are used to do in the UK. Avis Budget Group, Inc. reported weaker quarterly earning yesterday. From common experience, this should not be a surprise. The equity was down today 10% and the CDS 30bps wider. Car rental business is facing a very challenging environment and the hopes in new businesses - like the fleet maintenance - have been damped by the weakness of the core rental business including the used-car lower prices. The company should accelerate its transformation to overcome the deeper weakness of its core historic business. The recent bright spell for Avis could be short lived. 
"
"Koreaction. The credit index market was not immune to the negative headlines on North Korea. Looking at publicly reported trades in the swap data repositories – the tip of the iceberg -  more than 6 B€ and 12 B$ investment grade credit indices traded today in Europe and in the US, twice the average daily volumes since early July.  The correction was long overdue. At London close, the volume weighted average price was 54.75 bps for a 55 bps close for the European index and 60.2 for a 60 bps close for the US index. The indices have been prompt to widen due to the large amount of options written on these indices. The rest of the credit complex traded better.  The cash credit with the recent jumbo issuance like the BAT one is still attracting investors interest. The credit derivatives single names response to the weakness was mixed. In average, they did not widened as fast as the index. The credit index bases are closing wider across the board.
"
"Credit Indices are Leading the Pack. The credit index market was very active again today. From 6 B€ and 12 B$ investment grade credit indices reported yesterday in Europe and in the US in the swap data repositories, more than 9 B€ and 16 B$ risks  have been transferred today. There is more and more traction on risk reduction given the combination of risks and expensive valuation. However, the credit indices are feeling today most of the pain. The single name credit default swaps have lagged the spread widening. The bases, the difference between the credit indices and the single names are increasing. Looking at the attached Grapple (Basis Time Series Expert Tree in the Grapple Store), the bases in Europe and in the US are close to be at their highest level over the last 3 years. This is also the case for other indices. The bases are stretched and we could see either a sharp snap back on the indices or a whole repricing of credit risks.
"
"Taking Chips Off the Table. The investment grade credit indices are closing the week 5 bps and 4 bps wider at 57 bps and 61 bps respectively in Europe and in the US. This same week, the Korea Sovereign CDS is closing only 10 bps wider at 70 bps. However, we should note that the Korea CDS widening started at the end of 2016 while it was trading around 40 bps while the European and US benchmarks were both trading at 70 bps. Nevertheless, the current spike in Korea CDS is moderate considering what is at stake for the peninsula. It has traded as wide as 80 bps early 2016. Using DataGrapple, and selecting the whole-time series from 2006 up to now, the weekly move is more a tempest in a teapot. Investors have not rushed to hedge Asian credit risks, they just used the Korean crisis as an excuse to take chips off the table. Therefore, there is room for more decompression of the Korean CDS versus the investment grade indices. 

Regarding today’s session, the credit index market was again very active. After a weak open on credit indices - the European credit index trading as wide as 59.25 bps - the index rallied sharply in the afternoon - trading as tight as 56.65 bps -. Everyone is expecting   a little common sense and goodwill from all parties over the weekend.

"
"Watching the Sky. We could enjoy the peak of the Perseids meteor shower last Saturday night. The show in the night sky has eventually let cooler heads prevail. The credit indices market was much less active today than last week. The reported traded volumes are down 50% and 60% respectively in Europe and in the US compared to the peak of activity last week. The volumes are still healthy for a mid-August Monday.  The credit index market can be slightly disconnected this week from other markets due to the option expiry next Wednesday. The repricing of the spot has activated a lot of gamma which could pin the market. 

Meanwhile, Fiat Chrysler CDS traded 16 bps tighter on rumors that the company could reshuffle its various brands and potentially could merge with a Chinese automaker. The same day, the European Commission announced that it aims to strengthen its power to limit the Chinese takeovers on strategic companies. The Fiat 500 is surely iconic less strategic. But the car industry is at the eve of the electric revolution. Auto companies are strategic. The Commission must rush.

"
"Tension and Relaxation. Last Tuesday, New Look Retail Group Ltd. released its quarterly results. The EBIDTA was much weaker than expected by credit investors, down 40% y/y. The cost of credit protection jumped by 10% from 38% upfront plus 5% per annum to 48% upfront plus 5% per annum.  The initial move was due to many forced risk sellers like the CLO managers. The CDS stabilized at 50% upfront despite the market sell-off at the end of last week. Some distressed investors started to look at the risk reward in selling such a high premium. The other UK retailers traded better today with indication on progress on the Brexit negotiation.  The attached grapple displays the 5Y forward implied probability of default of the last 3 years. The pattern is quite impressive with spikes followed by recoveries. The trend for New Look is not positive. However, with an 80%-90% probability of default over the new five years, the risk is on the short side. Cycles of tension and relaxation could succeed one to another again in the coming months. 

Meanwhile, the credit index market was better bid. The European investment grade index is closing wider while other risky assets withstood better the lack of activity due to the Assumption public holidays in many continental European countries.

"No Rush to Buy. Consumers are not like investors. They are not rushing to buy as soon as there is a sale. Even a fire sale does not move them. They are not expecting any inflation soon. This is one of the FED issues of low inflation expectation and low wage growth. In their minutes released today, FED members are pointing out - to explain the lack of prices responsiveness - “restraints on pricing power from global developments and from innovations to business models spurred by advances in technology” . JCP (J.C. Penney Company, Inc. Ltd) released its quarterly results last Friday. The stock and the credit default swap have been slaughtered since the release. The CDS is 200bps wider at 900 bps running and the equity price is down 30% over the last week. JCP with around 875 stores left is trying to stop the desertification of shopping malls. But the wave of consumers using internet is unstoppable. All the retailers have their backs against the wall. They will fight to the death and prices is their only variable left. Inflation should not pick up rapidly.

Meanwhile, the credit index market was busy with the August option expiry. The daily tightening was floored in Europe at 55 bps. Dealers are expecting now a quieter end of month. All eyes are starting to focus on the next September roll for indices and single names.

"
"What ETAS Says?. The Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model is used to estimate a time-dependent probability of earthquake occurrence. In this model, each event triggers a new event and so on in a continuous sequence of possible chocks. The US president twits are offering a new field of application for this model. The intensity of the market movement is a good measure of the intensity of each event. The unpredictable is indeed predictable. 

The credit market was not immune to the US tensions. The US investment grade index was wider by 3 bps at London close and kept widening afterwards up to 62.5 bps. The credit indices are now trading at the widest level over the last month. However, the implied volatility is still offered at 1.5 bps per day. We have not yet seen a full repricing of the volatility. The volatility sellers have nerves of steel and an accurate ETAS model. 

"
"Plan B. Credit indices were again very weak during the whole trading session. The investment grade European credit index is noticeably an under performer.  
European credit index players have been caught off guard. Their consensus was on a “grind tighter” into the September roll – a smooth tightening of the index -. 
The 20th of September, six month will be added to credit index protections. Historically, hedging activity reduces ahead of the roll. 
Selling protection ahead of the roll has been a winning strategy over the last few years. The recent price action has upset this mechanical plan. 
They are too many buyers of European credit index protection. The index is now very expensive to buy compared to the cost of its members. 
Moreover, the cost  for hedging its members is also very expensive versus the cash instruments they are refering to. European credit index protection should be a sell. 
Popular in the market today, a plan B was offered to ""play safely the roll effect"": buy September receivers options. 
The option expiry is the same day of the index roll, the double witching for credit indices. 
The receiver options are still cheap. The implied volatility repricing is  contained. Plan B looks attractive.
"
"Brand Value. Most historical auto manufacturers stocks are  discounted with price earnings ratio between 5 and 7. The market discounts the huge diesel deception. Moreover, the equity valuation does reflect some skepticism over their capacity to survive the engines’ revolution as well as the self-driving game changer. However, these manufacturers own priceless gems: brands. Jeep - part of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV - is supposedly worth more than its owner itself. Great Wall Motor Co., a Chinese SUV manufacturer, is interested in buying the Jeep division. Fiat has just declined. The CDS tightened by 14 bps  and should trade below 200 bps quickly. There are many iconic brands, there is one new brand. The latter is looking overvalued and while the others are looking undervalued. What car you drive, what watch you wear are defining who you are. Not sure everyone wants to be a TAC (Tesla Apple Client). The success of Peugeot with the DS Brand is another example of heritage value. The auto sector is offering a lot of investment opportunities.

Meanwhile, the credit index market was unchanged. The activity was subdued and the reported volumes low.

"Il Redivivo. Some Sterling credit investors took a hit today with Provident Financial Plc October 2019 bond trading lower 30% while the equity was down 70%.  The company is a specialist in sub-prime credit. The CEO resignation, the dividend suspension, the operating loss on home credit business and a FCA probe were enough to trigger “a sell first, think later”. The very specific nature of this company worth 5B GBP 2 years ago, has not triggered an early warning on the state of the UK economy. The credit index market open stronger. However, the credit market under-performed the equity market. In Europe, some hedging activity was reported on Italy. Italy CDS is closing 6 bps wider at 143. Italian bank CDS have been better bid consequently. Silvio Berlusconi may partner up with other parties to push up for a new currency. Losing the Euro is a great risk for people with low income and pensioners. This idea has sealed the defeat of the far-right party in France. Nevertheless, Italy is facing many challenges. The market has just been reminded that each year there is a crucial election somewhere in Europe.

"Do as I say, not as I do. WPP blames “Uncertainty and short-termism reducing investment in favor of buybacks/dividends, although market levels lowering attraction” as a reason for the lack of dynamism of the advertising market. Companies are cutting costs to keep dividends & buy-backs very close to 100% of operating profits. At the same time WPP intends “Use of our substantial cash flow to enhance EPS through acquisitions, share buy-backs and debt reduction”. This was not enough to avoid the 10% drop in WPP’s share price today. WPP credit default swap did not react as much. The CDS is only 3 bps wider at 63 bps. Looking at the attached grapple, we see that the credit market is much more cautious on WPP for some time. The CDS is 40% wider than its lows mid-June. The company intends to use cheap debt to increase its net debt to twice its EBIDTA. The uncertainty of WPP’s  EBITDA is a new challenge for credit investors.  However, today was more an equity story with an interesting analyst presentation with a lot of data. WPP confirmed for instance the stress on the retail sector which is cutting on ads, -3% yoy.

Meanwhile, the credit index market was quiet. The credit index index option market was busier with some investors looking at options rather than outright hedges for the months to come.

"
"CDS Spleen. ELEPOR (EDP – Energias de Portugal, S.A.) credit default swap rallied by 16 bps today on orphaning risk per a publication from a major CDS market maker. ELEPOR is currently issuing new bonds through a Dutch subsidiary, EDP Finance BV. ELEPOR is not issuing any bond anymore directly from the operating company. Surprisingly there is only a keepwell agreement between the financing company and the operating company. According to the basics of banking only unconditional, irrevocable and at first demand guarantees are worth to be considered. ELEPOR bond investors are confident that the light recourse on the operating company is enough. Credit default swap investors are not so confident - a default on the bond does not trigger an ELEPOR credit default swap event. The ELEPOR CDS should be rolled into a CDS referencing directly the financing company. This does make no sense. There are so many cases where the financing vehicles are transformed and the buyers of CDS are left with an orphaned CDS. This has happened so many times for members of the European high yield universe. Investing in CDS on a financing vehicle is a bet - not a hedge - due to the orphaning risk for the buyer and the subordination risk for the seller. As a rule of thumb, CDS on operating companies only are worth to be invested in rationally. CDS on financing vehicles should be avoided.

Meanwhile, the credit market is on standby waiting for the omen from Jackson Hole.

"Janet's Grapple. “Credit default swaps for the large banks also suggest that market participants assign a low probability
 to the distress of a large U.S. banking firm”, Janet Yellen keynote speech at Jackson Hole. 
 The Chair of the FED dedicated most of her remarks today to the strength of the US financial institutions.
  The attached Grapple plots the market implied 5Y probabilities of default for the US global systemically 
  important banks (G-SIBs). Notwithstanding the survivor bias, 
  the Grapple shows an obvious recovery from a range of 10% - 20% cumulative implied probabilities
   of default at the peak of the crisis to a 3% - 6% range.  The probabilities are much lower but
    also much closer one to another. However, they are not back to their pre-GFC tights, around 1% to 2%. 
	The market is pricing the bail-in risk. This is matching the FED expectations. 
	  Nevertheless, a 4% 5Y cumulative default probability for JP or 6% for GS are low but far
	   from being insignificant. Also – and this should be the subject of more studies – the machine 
	   is computing that the cluster of banks is closer to the cluster of HY credits than to the cluster 
	   of IG credits.  No doubt, the banks are at risk in any reversal of the credit cycle, first affecting
	    the HY credits.  Consequently, more decorrelation of the banks’ spreads from the US HY spreads would be a strong signal on the strength of the US G-SIBs. We shall keep an eye on this Grapple.

"These Times Are Over. Houston was born slightly more than a century ago from the wreckage of a cataclysmic storm, which hit nearby Galveston, then one of the US busiest ports. It is at the center of the region currently hit by hurricane Harvey, which promises once again to test the local economy after drenching the area with more than 36 inches of rain and more expected to come over the next few days. Around 450,000 residents will require assistance and more than 30,000 will probably need to be displaced. Harvey will cause most likely cause more flood damage than Katrina and, even if loss estimates vary widely, many say costs could surpass $100Bln. MUNRE ( Muenchener Rueck ) and SCHREI ( Swiss Re AG ) said it is too early to provide loss estimates, economic or insured. Due to the ongoing bad weather, they reckon it will take weeks before reliable estimates of the losses are available. There was a time when investors would have rushed to buy protection on the biggest re-insurers, but not this time. These companies have proved resilient time and time again. And, even though their risk premia were pushed a bit wider, the moves were contained. While MUNRE’s 5-year CDS closed 2.5bps wider at 34bps, SCHREI’s closed 3.5bps wider at 47bps.
"
"When Tight Is Not Tight Enough. BBVA brought to the market today €1.5Bln of senior non-preferred debt. Non-preferred senior debt is eligible in order to comply with the requirement of the MREL regulation. MREL (which stands for Minimum Requirement for own funds and Eligible Liabilities) was added to the alphabet soup of post crisis regulatory reforms aimed at ending “too big to fail”, together with the TLAC (Total Loss Absorbing Capacity). Banks are required to meet a MREL so as to be able to absorb losses and restore their capital position during and after a crisis. Senior non-preferred debt is therefore a new category of debt instrument with a greater legal capacity to absorb losses than traditional senior debt. The BBVA issue, which has a 5-year maturity, attracted more than €5Bln in client demand, so that the initial guidance of a mid-swap (MS) + 85bps coupon was later reduced to MS + 70bps. All of a sudden, it made the 5-year CDS of BBVA which referenced senior debt quite expensive in the high 60s. Investors duly corrected it, and sent it 5.5bps tighter at 61.5bps, making it the outperformer of the financial sector in Europe.
"
"Brick And Mortar Can Hurt Too. CAFP ( CArrefour ) surprised the market today with a profit warning. Its shares plunged more than 13% and its 5-year risk premium increased 9bps to 64bps after the company said that full year operating profit will decline a similar amount as the 12% drop in the first half. Alexandre Bompard, CAFP’s new CEO, has been recruited partly for his ability to see off the likes of Amazon, after he gained a reputation for his digital expertise when he successfully steered Fnac Darty into e-commerce. While CAFP was hit by difficulties in Argentina, it mostly had to face a step-up in competition on its home turf, as Leclerc, the low-price supermarket chain, overtook CAFP as France’s biggest grocer by market share. Leclerc recently grew more aggressive in its promotions, and CAFP had to beef up its own price cuts, one of the main factors behind its warning that the second part of the year will be as tough as the first. If on-line retailers are certainly a threat, brick and mortar competitors can cause pain too.

"And Whoosh It Was Gone. CSTM ( Constellium NV ) operates as a downstream aluminium producer. Its products serve a broad range of applications. The company sells aircraft parts, industrial coil, window frames and car bodies to aerospace, automotive and packaging customers around the world. It was introduced in the series 27 of iTraxx Crossover so that the number of that index constituents stays at 75, but its inclusion could be short lived. It has been one of the star performers in the Crossover universe since early August, when it was first reported that CSTM was weighing options after drawing takeover interests. Rumours of a takeover resurfaced yesterday, when articles stated that Hindalco Industries Ltd, a conglomerate belonging to Indian billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla, would be taking a close look at CSTM or Aleris as potential targets via its subsidiary Novelis (currently single B rated). One would think this would be a mutually exclusive event, and it is tough to tell at this stage whether CSTM ticks more boxes from Novelis’ perspective. Investors considered it likely enough to shave another 40bps off CSTM’s 5-year risk premium and sent it to 220bps. It has been halved over the last month.

"Déjà Vu. It felt like “déjà vu” this morning as the week-end headlines were once again dominated by the latest North Korea missile test. Yesterday’s was a “perfect success” according to the Korean Central News Agency, as an underground explosion caused a magnitude 6.3 earthquake. It set the stage for a weak session, but with each development more serious than the last – and each coming in quick succession – financial markets will surely have more thinking about what the endgame is here in the coming days. Last week’s missile launch over Japan was brushed aside as a mere act of bravado, and the measured reaction from the US helped the market do so. The nuclear test over the week-end might be more difficult to ignore, and the current assumption that a stalemate is the most likely outcome could be challenged. If further escalation were to be priced in at some stage, there would be a fair few extra hedges to be bought. There is currently hardly any positioning on the back of it, and it could take the market a fair amount wider than the 1bp increase of iTraxx Main’s risk premium we have witnessed today.
"
"Contradicting Forces. Today’s session illustrates the schizophrenic state of the credit market. On the one hand, the situation in North Korea is showing no sign of easing. The U.N. Security Council held an emergency meeting and American Ambassador Nikki Haley said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is ""begging for war."" It was then no surprise that US investors were in a risk off mood when they came back from their long week-end, and the 2bps widening of CDX IG’s risk premium was to be expected. On the other hand, the next CDS roll which will mark the launch of new credit index series (28 in Europe and 29 in the US) and the introduction of new “on-the-run” single reference contracts (bearing a December 2022 maturity rather than the current June 2022 “on-the-run” maturity) is only a couple of weeks away. It undoubtedly biased investors towards getting rid of June 2022 protection in any weakness before potentially replacing them with December 2022 at a later stage. It was the case in Europe, which, after widening yesterday while the US were shut, found it very difficult to take it further today and closed the session unchanged.


"
"Others Will Follow Harvey. The extent of the damages caused by hurricane are not fully known yet, and the US are already bracing themselves for the next storm: Irma. It could reach Florida as early as Saturday, and its destructive potential is clear after it swept over islands in the Caribbean. It is the most powerful storm to form in the open Atlantic Ocean, and it has wreaked havoc on the French islands of Saint-Barthélemy and Saint-Martin. They were hit by 12-meter waves and top winds were holding at more than 185 miles (300km) an hour, making the system a category 5 storm, the highest measure on the 5-step Saffir Simpson scale. According to witnesses, the arrival of Irma was best described as the explosion of a bomb. It is therefore not surprising that investors started to ask questions about the potential impact on reinsurers which are bearing most of the risks if damages in the US were to mount substantially. If the CDS referencing the senior debt of MUNRE ( Muenchener Rueck ), SCHREI ( Swiss Re AG ), and HANRUE ( Hannover Rueck ) were all marked wider at 37bps (+5bps), 50bps (+5bps) and 38bps (+4bps) respectively, CDS referencing their subordinated debt bore the brunt of the widening at 90bps (-14bps), 107bps (+15bps) and 95bps (+15bps) respectively.

"Not What Investors Orderd For Christmas. TOYS (Toys ""R"" Us) was taken private by KKR, Bain Capital and Vornado Realty Trust in a 2005 deal valued at $6.6Bln. Last year, the retailer behind the Toys ""R"" Us and Babies ""R"" brands successfully refinanced some of its debt. But after a weak holiday season for toys sales, TOYS was forced to lay off some of its employees in February. Competition has been increasing from both brick and mortar and online players. Big-box stores such as Wal-Mart have for years driven down prices of toys to draw parents into their stores to buy other more expensive goods. E-commerce giant Amazon has become a formidable competitor. TOYS is not the only one to feel the pressure. The number of retail bankruptcies has increased recently, and it has become all the more difficult for leveraged retailers to tap the market. That is why TOYS is looking to address its debt load now, prior to the holiday season, to give its vendors such as Mattel and Hasbro clarity into the company's long term viability to help it continue stock its shelves throughout the holidays. TOYS has hired law firm Kirkland & Ellis to consider its options. An article published yesterday mentioned that one debt restructuring option considered could be a bankruptcy filing. That was enough to spook investors who sent TOYS' risk premium through the roof. So much so that, at the end of the session, TOYS' default probability over the next 5 years had shot up to 72%.

"The Week That Was. The main themes of the week were nothing new to market participants. The focus was first on North Korea and much of the talks Monday and Tuesday centred on the latest nuclear test carried out over the week-end. But once again, any concerns investors might have had early on were swiftly brushed aside and, at the end of the week, risk premia were tighter across the board. People still appear more concerned by the coming roll than any escalation in Korea. The focus then turned to natural disasters, as Irma followed Harvey. The hurricane swept over the Caribbean, devastating a chain of islands, ahead of an all but certain collision with Southern Florida. While Irma has weakened slightly recently, it has grown in size, and it threatens to become the most expensive storm in US history. If at first investors were a tad slow to push insurers and reinsurers’ risk premia wider, the move gained momentum as the week progressed, and that group was the clear underperformer over the last five trading sessions.

"Another Orphan In iTraxx Crossover?. WINDIM (Wind Acquisition Finance S.A.) has $5.2Bln as well as €5.35Bln of bonds outstanding with maturities ranging between 2019 and 2021. The company has long been rumoured to look at refinancing options. It looks as if it could finally materialise, as the redemption price of their existing notes have been decreasing. Wind, the Italian telecom group should launch a cross border refinancing in October for their whole debt pile. The transaction, which would enable them to extend their maturities, will include a combination of a jumbo bond – targeting institutional investors - and a large loan tranche – targeting bank lenders -. The story triggered a spike in the volume of WINDIM’s CDS traded today as some people anticipated a possible orphaning if the new debt is not issued out of the current special purpose entity, Wind Acquisition Finance SA. The theory gained traction during the session and the CDS eventually closed the session 30bps at 174bps, its tightest level ever.

"What Is At Stake?. Fixed-odds betting terminals – FOBT – have been dubbed the crack cocaine of gambling. They are very addictive machines. In the UK, they allow punters to stake up to £100 every 20 seconds and the latter spend roughly £1Bln a week trying their luck with them. They are cash cows for bookmakers, and of course they are cash cows for the Treasury for which they generate hundreds of millions of pounds in revenue every year. That was the main reason Mr Hammond had been reportedly resisting curbs on FOTB. But according to press reports, the Chancellor is now said to have accepted the need for a clamp down. Next month, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport will publish a report focusing “on stakes and prizes of machines, social responsibility within the industry and gambling advertising” in the Autumn, and the Government. People now expects the Government to limit the stakes on FOBT in its wake, potentially to £2 a turn. Investors did not wait for October to react, and they pushed LADLN’s ( Ladbrokes Plc  ) 5-year risk premium 10bps wider at 333bps.

"Nordstrom Wants To Focus On Nordstrom. Though JWN’s (Nordstrom, Inc) sales have slowed, the company has generally performed better than most department store chains and since June JWN’s founding family has been mulling solutions to go private. When the rumours first surfaced, JWN’s 5-year risk premium jumped from 160bps to 320bps but it has then trended back tighter and it was trading at 230bps yesterday. Overnight press reports mentioned that family members, who own more than 30% of the retailer, are close to picking a private equity firm, Leonard Green & Partners, to help put a buyout together. Leonard Green would provide $1bln in equity which would help raising $7 to $8bln in debt in order to finance a deal that could be formally announced in a couple of weeks. The perspective revived investors’ worries, and they pushed JWN’s 5-year risk premium 61bps wider to 293bps, en route to exceed the widest levels of this summer.

"They Will Not Be Missed. Credit Default Swaps (CDS) referencing NSINO ( Norske Skogindustrier ) were triggered in July after the company missed a €17mln interest payment on one of the bonds it had issued. It was the second credit event on the name in 18 months. The first followed a debt restructuring which did not address any of the issues facing NSINO and was merely designed to accommodate a group of bondholders who, at the time, also owned protection against a default of the company. It left the papermaker struggling with $1Bln of debt and slumping newspaper readership. A few days ago, the long running saga took another twist when senior secured bondholders demanded immediate repayment of their notes after NSINO unveiled another debt restructuring proposal. These senior secured bondholders have a claim over most of NSINO’s asset, including its seven paper mills. Even though they are yet to take possession of any assets, that latest twist, which paves the way for a complicated and unpredictable process, spooked investors ahead of the auction which was held today to determine the payout of the CDS. They almost zeroed the expected value going forward of any existing debt other than the senior secured notes, setting the recovery at 2.25%. An investor who had insured 10M€ of debt will get 9.775M€. It was a brutal end to a long agony on that CDS.
"
"The End Of The Game. A number of TOY’s (Toys R Us) suppliers are said to have cut back their shipments to the retailer. TOY has allegedly open talks with lenders over a new loan that would allow the company to stay open while it works out a recovery plan through bankruptcy proceedings. It has thus become extremely expensive for vendors to insure their shipments, as they often rank among the creditors with the lowest priority for getting repaid if a company seeks court protection. Their decision on whether to continue shipping goods will play a decisive part in determining TOY’s fate. Investors rushed to snap up protection on the back of these rumours. They pushed the cost of the 5-year protection up 13pts to 61pts upfront (it costs $61 upfront to insure $100 of debt plus another $5 annually). They also flattened dramatically the risk premium curve, making it almost as expensive to insure debt over 1 year than it is to insure it over 5. The market only sees 1 chance out of 3 that TOY will survive over the next 12 months.

"They Are Junk No More. For once it was a quiet week-end in terms of headlines. There was no missile launch nor any tornado hitting the US shores. We saw last week how easily investors brushed aside worrying headlines, and this morning it seemed that no news was good news. Without any specific catalyst, the tone was firm in the market from the word “go” and risky assets traded positively across the board. Credit was further helped by S&P;’s upgrade of Portugal to BBB- from BB+. The outlook is stable, and the action ends Portugal’s spell among junk rated credits which started in January 2012. The yield of 10-year Portuguese government bonds was 35bps lower at 2.4% and Portugal’s 5-year risk premium was 13bps tighter at 133bps. It lifted peripheries’ spirit, and prompted some outperformance among financials. It triggered some short covering, particularly on BCPPL (Banco Comercial Portugues) which saw its 5-year CDS tightened 31bps to 189bps.
"
"Italy Did It As Well. On the day before the roll – new series of index will be issued tomorrow on all indices except CDX HY which will wait for another week -, investors owning protection did not felt very comfortable. While other risky assets experienced an unremarkable session, credit felt very firm and protection was offered across the board. In Europe, the move was compounded by the very strong performance of the Italian banks. Their risk premia were pushed aggressively tighter – 7bps for Intesa and Mediobanca at 68bps and 85bps respectively, and 8bps for Unicredit at 71bps - after an article in Il Sole mentioned that the Italian finance ministry would be in the process of writing down a plan for new “intermediate bonds”. These should be Non-Preferred Senior (NPS) debt since Italy has tried statutory subordination before. The potential creation of NPS tranche in Italian solvency law has been well flagged before, but investors were not expecting it to form part of the 2018 budget’s section on banking and finance, which means chances are this goes into Parliament mid-October.

"What Did Corporate America Miss Overnight?. Today was the day market participants extended the maturity of what are dubbed “on-the-run” contracts, which concentrate most of the liquidity. During this roll, the maturity of 5-year CDS was pushed by 6 months, from June 2022 to December 2022. The longer the maturity, the higher the risk premium. As a rule of thumb, in the investment grade universe, 6 months are worth 10 to 15%. For 2 diversified indices, you would expect a 6-month extension in the region of 12%. Looking at iTraxx Main in Europe and CDX IG in the US offers 2 very different results though. In the US, market participants were fairly rational and the “on-the-run” 5-year risk premia of CDX IG constituents which were worth 52bps on average yesterday were worth 59bps tonight. According to them, Corporate America had not changed overnight. In Europe, the average risk premium of iTraxx Main constituents went from 49.5bps yesterday to 53bps tonight. Some 3.5bps went missing and risk premia effectively tightened by roughly 3bps. According to market participants, European corporations are in much better shape today than they were yesterday.
"
"What Happened To Financials ??. A couple of days ago, iTraxx Financials Senior (ITXES) - which references European banks and insurance companies - was trading 4bps tighter than iTraxx Main (ITXEB) - which references the most liquid European investment grade companies  including the earlier mentioned 30 financials -. It was the situation on series 27, but that all changed with the introduction of the series 28. Markit has decided to issue ITXEB under revised index rules. Even though the names of the banks included in the indices are the same at first glance, UK and Swiss banks are now included at HoldCo level rather than the less risky Operating level of the previous index series. For each concerned entity, the difference is substantial. The risk premia ratio of the HoldCo compared with the OpCo ranges from 1.5 for HSBC (27bps for the OpCo and 41bps for the HoldCo) to almost 2 for UBS (26bps for the OpCo and 49bps for the HoldCo). From series 27 to series 28, the change added roughly 6bps to ITXES and 1.5bps to ITXEB. It explains the whole underperformance of ITXES during the past 5 trading sessions.

"Wanted: Buyers Of Short Dated CDS. In the credit derivatives market, this week was all about rolling CDS positions. The maturity of so-called 5-year CDS has been extended from June 2022 to December 2022. The longer the maturity of a CDS contract, the higher its risk premium is. In the US, given where the June 2022 maturity was priced on Tuesday night, December 2022 was almost priced to perfection when it started trading on Wednesday. The same cannot really be said for shorter maturities. When the December 2020 CDS - aka the new 3-year contracts - started trading on Wednesday, they were indicated at roughly the same levels the June 2020 CDS closed on Tuesday. Dealers have been asked relentlessly to show bids for short dated protection by carry hungry investors, and none of them cares to buy any more. The result was an agressive steepening of the risk premium curves across the board. While a 3-year risk premium trading at 50% of the 5-year risk premium has long been considered an opportunity to buy protection, they are now trading on average at 40% in the US investment grade universe.

"Will Maserati Go East?. Last month, reports emerged that Fiat Chrysler is mulling a plan to spin-off Maserati and Alfa Romeo, the sports-car brands it owns, in order to sharpen its focus on mass market vehicles. VW ( Volkswagen AG ) is considering selling non-core assets such as the Ducati motorcycle brand. Meanwhile, senior officials of Tata Group, which owns TTMTIN (Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc), are said to believe the carmaker needs to bulk up to stay competitive. TTMTIN represents roughly 78% of Tata Motor’s revenues. It has not made any acquisition since it was bought for $2.4Bln in 2008, and the Indian conglomerate, which has amassed a record amount of cash – it currently sits on $6.2Bln - would be willing to provide financial support for potential deals. When investors heard that Tata could snap up a foreign automaker for its luxury Jaguar Land Rover brand, they pushed the latter’s 5-year risk premium 11bps wider at 190bps. Since the tights reached at the beginning of August, TTMTIN’s 5-year CDS has now widened by roughly 70bps.

"A Double Barrel Of Bad News. BOMB’s ( Bombardier, Inc ) turnaround plan is coming under threat from stepped-up challenges to the company’s cutting-edge jetliner and to its rail business. The US government is set to decide next week whether to impose tariffs on BOMB’s C Series aircraft after a complaint from BA ( Boeing Co ). A preliminary ruling is expected on the 5th October as to whether they have sold their C Series at artificially low prices which would subject them to duties on planes they sold to US airlines. Separately, SIEGR’s ( Siemens AG ) railway business was reported this morning to potentially be merging with ALOFP (Alstom SA) after months of talks with BOMB. Losing out on a SIEGR deal would weaken BOMB’s rail unit, its biggest business, while an adverse ruling in the US would hamper demand for its priciest jetliner. This has led investors to push BOMB’s 5-year risk premium steadily wider since the September roll. In a week it has moved 102bps wider to 448bps, where it seemed to have found a clearing level as 2-way flow eventually developed today. 
"
"That Market Is Dull. Since the roll, it is fair to say that indices have stayed in a very narrow range, and today was no exception. Credit opened firm as equities were boosted by details on the US tax plan overnight and a weaker euro. However, rates sold off aggressively and the move tighter stalled. The late dip in equities did not impact credit indices, and the intraday moves were once again very limited. Financials tried to rally as it is usually accepted that higher rates are a better environment for them, but hedges were reset throughout the session. iTraxx Financials series 28 has not been trading well since it was issued a week ago, and it has underperformed all other indices. iTraxx Financials Senior, which closed at 60bps, and iTraxx Financials Subordinated, which closed at 137bps, are the only 2 indices to be wider on that period. iTraxx Main is unchanged at 57.5bps and iTraxx Crossover is 2bps at 254bps.

"Will Monolines Come Back To Haunt The Market?. A couple of days ago, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the rating of the City of Hartford from Caa1 to Caa3, taking the city’s roughly $500mln debt further into junk category. The rating agency commented that its action “reflect(ed) the likelihood of default as early as November and a higher probability of significant bondholder impairment given impending bankruptcy”. FSA (Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp), which insures more than $300mln of the municipality’s debt, consequently said it was open to debt restructuring and willing to extend financial help to prevent the city from filing for bankruptcy. The amounts at stake do not represent a threat to FSA, but the news was a wakeup call to credit investors. The city of Hartford is not an isolated case and many municipalities are facing mounting liabilities. If more were to adopt a more aggressive stance with bondholders, the life of monolines could be about to become much tougher. The market is far for from pricing a catastrophic scenario at the moment. But if FSA’s 5-year risk premium is nowhere near the peak reached in 2009 – on the above Grapple you can see a full history by clicking on the “Max” option in the left end corner -, it has been rising steadily over the last week. Today, it jumped a further 45bps to 184bps.

"Yuck!. The failings of the food industry are in the spotlight again. This morning, ITV News and the Guardian have published a report that claims to have uncovered a series of safety breaches at the poultry plants of 2 Sisters Food Group (2SFG). The allegations involve tampering slaughter date of poultry being processed at sites that supply retailers including Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Marks & Spencer, Aldi and Lidl. The latters all said they would launch enquiries. Several of them decided to remove from their shelves products coming from the incriminated sites without further ado and have vowed to suspend their relationship with the firm until the investigation has concluded. 2SFG was founded in 1993 and now produces one third of all the poultry products consumed in the UK, and had revenues of £3.1Bln in 2016. Investors took the matter very seriously and parent company BOPRLN (Boparan Finance Plc) was under severe pressure as soon as the reports came out. Its 5-year risk premium jumped 169bps to 738bps. That is its widest level since it joined iTraxx Crossover 3 years ago.

"No Spanish Fever. 
European and world leaders are urging dialogue between Spain’s government and authorities in Catalonia. They said they are worried about the potential for further escalation after a violent crackdown by Spanish police during the independence referendum held over the week-end. With the Catalan parliament expected to declare independence in the next few days, they stressed that talks are urgently needed. The violence that accompanied Sunday’s referendum, which was deemed unconstitutional, also increased investors’ concern about rising euro-area political risks. They leaned against the euro – it was down 0.6% against the dollar today – and put pressure on Spanish debt – Bonos were 10bps wider against Bund at one point -, but the weakness was contained. The Spanish sovereign CDS was 7bps wider at 70bps, but that is a blip rather than a spike, and today’s move was a far cry from the 35bps increase that saw it traded at 135bps the day after the UK voted for Brexit. It was another blatant example of how easily the credit market – like most risky assets - is currently brushing aside any piece of news that has the potential to derail it from its bullish trajectory.

"Fourth Time Lucky?. In March this year, GNW’s ( Genworth Financial Inc ) shareholders approved the $2.7bln takeover of the company by China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co. announced in October 2016. Since then, regulatory hurdles to win US approval have proven insurmountable for both companies. Yesterday, they said they have withdrawn their voluntary notice to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US - which scrutinizes the acquisitions of US companies by foreign entities - for the third time. Both companies are still committed to the deal, but the clock is ticking for GNW. It has to address debt maturing in 2018. The longer it operates on a stand-alone basis, the more pressure on the ratings of its US Mortgage Insurance Unit, which is its most valuable business. China Oceanwide reaffirmed that “GNW remains a critical part of (their) strategy to bring long term care and other insurance solutions to China”, but investors saw this latest development as bearish regarding the closing of the transaction. GNW’s stock tumbled roughly 13% and its risk premium was pushed 93bps to 753bps compared with last Friday.

"Can Monolines Weather The Storm?. Puerto Rico “owe(s) a lot of money to your friends on Wall Street and we’re going to have to wipe that out. (…) You can say goodbye to that. (…) I don’t know if it’s Goldman Sachs, but whoever it is you can wave good-bye to that”. President Trump comment made in a Fox News interview yesterday suggesting that the government debt accumulated by bankrupt state would need to be wiped clean to help the island recover from the devastation caused by recent hurricanes did not go down well with monoline investors. Most of them have some kind of exposure to Puerto Rico’s debt, as they have insured part of the $74Bln owed due to bondholders. FSA (Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp) and National Public Finance Guarantee, a unit of MBIA, both insured more than $7Bln. Even if Mr Trump’s declaration should probably not be taken at face value and if none of these two companies will be liable for the full amount they covered, the sums involved are massive. The market reaction was brutal. FSA’s 5-year risk premium increased by 42.5bps to 225bps while MBIA’s increased 144bps to 657bps.

"Let’s Celebrate The Prospect Of An Earlier Death. TSCOLN ( Tesco Plc ) posted yesterday pretty strong first half results. The company continues to implement its current strategy in the UK and its margins are benefitting from it in a tough environment. Cash flow generation has been solid, boosted by minimum capex, working capital improvements and some marginal disposal proceeds. All in all, the balance sheet is gaining strength, which vindicates the management’s objective to return TSCOLN to an investment grade rating. Credit metrics were also helped by a dramatic reduction in the company’s pension deficit. It has gone down £3Bln to £2.4Bln. This whopping fall comes from a change in the discount rate used to compute the present value of future pension payments - TSCOLN no longer uses yields of gilt and uses instead the yields of investment grade bonds which are higher – and from findings by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Ltd, which produces the longevity forecasts used by corporate pension schemes and insurers, which show that the average life expectancy of men and women aged 65 declined in the past couple of years. As one commentator put it, “Tesco Plc's investors had plenty to smile about on Wednesday, even if one reason to celebrate was the prospect of an earlier death”. After a 15bps drop since the beginning of the week, at 130bps, TSCOLN’s 5-year risk premium is back to its tightest level of the last 3 years.

"We Price Something They Don’t. Except for a handful of special situations in the US and Catalonian banks, individual names have been rock solid throughout the week. The main theme for the week has been the broad-based performance of cash, with a preference for higher beta and duration products. New issues all performed well in this environment, and investors seemed to be more concerned about buying the dip than hedging. On the day, investment grade credits were unchanged on average in Europe and 0.5bps wider in the US, while high yield credits were tighter by 0.5bps in Europe and 1.5bps in the US. This price action was a bit at odd with what we saw on credit indices, especially in Europe. They suffered from a rise in volatility because of headlines saying North Korea would be ready to test missiles capable of reaching the US West Coast, and because of the uncertainty that still surrounds the situation in Catalonia. Ahead of what will be a 3-day week-end in the US, a few purchases of protection were made. They took credit indices off their tightest levels, and sent bases – the difference the traded values of indices and the theoretical values computed using the prices of their individual constituents – to higher levels across the board.
"
"It Does Not Look Good. NEWLOK (New Look) entered the iTraxx Crossover index in 2015, when it was bought by Brait Capital, a South African investor, in a £1.9Bln takeover. Since then, the life of the retailer which sells fashion mainly for women and teenage girls, has got quite complicated. Its risk premium has been relentlessly rising, and already spiked twice this year to distressed level: in June when it warned of challenging times ahead citing an increase in online competition and in August when it announced profits had crashed 60% in the three months to June. Ever since, distressed debt investors have been rumoured to be circling part of the company’s £1.2Bln debt pile. This saga might come to an end in the not too distant future. It was reported in the week-end press that NEWLOK would have hired restructuring specialists, and that Brait would be interested in buying some of the company’s bonds to improve its negotiating position in future debt talks. That was enough for investors to hammer NEWLOK’s risk premium across all maturities, and they pushed the company’s 1-year probability of default to almost 40%. Recently we have been used to entities exiting iTraxx Crossover because they became empty shells without any outstanding debt, NEWLOK could be the first in a while to head for the exit because of a default.

"Fraud Is Their Worst Fear. When Japanese investors came back from their Health-Sports bank holiday week-end, they were not prepared for the industrial scandal that is engulfing KOBSTL ( Kobe Steel, Ltd ). The maker of metals and alloys announced that some of its staff falsified data about the strength and durability of aluminium and copper products used in trains and planes. These products, which were delivered to more than 200 companies, were made to look as if they met client quality standards. Even though the company added that there haven’t been any reports of safety issues, the cost to KOBSTL could be huge if it has to shoulder the costs of potential recalls, but also in the form of reputational harm and possible legal challenges. Because it is very difficult to anticipate, fraud has always been the main risk credit investors are facing and once they are aware of it, they show no mercy. Since the beginning of 2016 and the energy led commodity crisis, KOBSTL had been a well-behaved credit – some might even call it boring – and the company’s 5-year risk premium had been trading between 50 and 60bps over the past 3 months. Today it soared 180bps and closed at 235bps. It could be the beginning of a much bumpier road ahead.
"
"Which One Should Be On Top?. When they were issued on the 20th September, iTraxx Main Series 28 (ITXEB28) and CDX IG Series 29, the investment grade credit benchmark indices in Europe and in the US respectively, traded at the same level. Back then, the fair value – i.e. the risk premium of an index computed using the individual prices of its constituents – of ITXEB28 was already 3bps tighter than the fair value of CDXIG29. The difference between these fair values has been very stable over the past 3 weeks. It has not prevented the spread between ITXEB28 and CDXIG29 to move around. This spread has been a barometer of investors’ concern regarding the political situation in Spain. It moved between -1bp (ITXEB28 tighter than CDXIG29) when the referendum was not certain to be held, to +3bps after the violence that marred the vote held in Catalonia. Yesterday’s speech by Mr Puigdemont was interpreted by the market as a sign of easing. Even though it was not clear whether Catalonia’s independence had been declared or not, it was deemed reassuring enough to bring ITXEB28 and CDXIG29 at the same level.

"What A Default Does To CDX HY. Looking at the above grapple, you could be forgiven to imagine that the HY universe in the US is a much safer place today than it was yesterday. All series of CDX HY (except series 29 which does not appear yet on DataGrapple anyway) have seen their risk premia decrease meaningfully. In fact, the latter were roughly unchanged across the board. But while CDX HY indices previously enabled you to be compensated for loss arising from the recent default of TOY (Toys R Us), it is no longer the case. For instance, if you bought $100mln of protection on CDX HY 28 on Wednesday, you would have been entitled to receive 740k$ as a compensation for the default of TOY. That amount was decided yesterday after market participants had the opportunity to take part in an auction aimed at estimating what bondholders could ultimately get from the company if they hold on to their securities. After the auction, TOY was effectively stripped from the index, and CDX HY S28 has now only 99 constituents, down from 100. The residual maturity of CDX HY S28 is roughly 4.5 years (it matures in June 2022), so the 740k$ protection buyers got yesterday are worth 165k$ per year, which is 0.165% of the $100mln. That is pretty much the amount (17bps) that was taken out of CDX HY S28 risk premium.

"It Is Not Our Problem… Yet. The earning season is only beginning but it has already claimed some casualties. And one of them has not even reported yet… Engineering group GKN ( GKN Plc ) brought forward a scheduled trading update to warn investors that “management pre-tax profit” would be only slightly above last year’s £678mln. The company has a large aerospace division. It admitted that trading at the North American arm in the third quarter of the year has been disappointing and that efforts to boost productivity had failed to pay off. Additionally, GKN has been made aware of two legal claims related to aerospace and driveline technologies that will result in a charge of about £40mln in the fourth quarter. Neither of the claims, which came “as a complete surprise”, should suggest a fundamental problem with GKN’s operational functions according to the management, even though they declined to give further details. Investors were not impressed and they punished GKN’s stock, sending it almost 10% lower. They consider it is very much an equity issue at the moment though, and GKN’s 5-year CDS was only 3bps wider at 91bps, in an otherwise globally positive market (iTraxx Main finished the day 0.5bps tighter at 55.5bps).

"What A Round Trip. Today was a particularly quiet session. iTraxx Main traded in a 0.25bps range for 10 hours, which tells you the whole story. There were a few patches of activity though. In Europe, TSCOLN ( Tesco Plc ) was by far the biggest mover in the investment grade universe. Its 5-year risk premium closed the day 12bps tighter at 109bps following the announcement of a £700mln tender offer. The company is offering to buy its bonds in GBP – with a particular focus on their 2042 and 2057 maturities – and one bond in euros maturing in 2019. The rationale for the buy-back reads as follows: “the offers are being made in the context of Tesco’s continuing efforts to strengthen the balance sheet and are aimed at efficiently using surplus liquidity to reduce debt”. Moody’s said that the tender could cut leverage by 0.2 times and was credit positive. Today’s measures will help the company accelerate towards the management goal of once again being an investment grade company. For reference, TSCOLN’s 5-year risk premium was last trading below 120bps in late 2014, before the profit warning that ultimately sent them to junk in 2015, and it hit 325bps in 2016. What a turnaround story…
"
"Not Out Of The Wood Yet, But…. PSON ( Pearson Plc ) gave a trading update this morning, which went down well with investors. Despite challenges (revenues fell 2% in the first nine months of the year), owing to the relative strength of the US higher education business as digital revenues increased 11% and the division rallied from last year’s unprecedented slump, the company was able to narrow its full year guidance towards the upper end of its previous estimates. 2017 cash flow and the bottom line will benefit from lower taxes (16% versus an initial 21% guidance) and from a reduction in financial expenses. Net debt at the end of the third quarter was a touch lower than it was at the end of 2016, even before taking into account the sale of PSON’s 22% stake in Penguin Random House finalised in October, thanks to good cash-flow generation and the off-loading of the Global Education Business. Also, a third of the publisher’s pension liabilities were off-loaded to Aviva and Legal & General through a bulk annuity deal. There is still some way to go improve the metrics to levels that are commensurate with the current BBB rating, but the commitment of the management to improve the balance sheet was rewarded with a further reduction of PSON’s 5-year risk premium to 88bps, almost 60bps off the peak reached at the very beginning of 2017.
"
"Gone With Wind Tre. The much-awaited refinancing of Wind is finally under way. The company began today the marketing of a jumbo transaction. Bonds issued will amount to €7.3Bln split between 5 different tranches consisting of USD and Euro notes, with maturities ranging from 5 to 8 years. It will be the biggest junk-bond sale by a European borrower since Numericable Group and Altice SA sold the equivalent of more than €10Bln in April 2014. The company should use the proceeds to repurchase existing outstanding notes. The operation will help Italy’s largest mobile-phone company to cut its debt expenses as borrowing costs are near record lows. Even though the deal is expected to be well received - Wind is a well-known name, and there will be demand by investors to replace their existing bonds holdings -, given the sheer size of the deal, you would expect some kind of pressure on Wind’s 5-year CDS. But there was a catch. The new debt will come out of Wind Tre Spa, and not WINDIM (Wind Acquisition Finance SA). There will be a guarantee, but market participants are of the opinion that the language does not satisfy the unconditionality and irrevocability that would make the new bonds deliverable into existing WINDIM CDS. WINDIM could therefore join the cohort of orphaned names referencing empty boxes. Its risk premium collapsed and finished the session 52bps tighter at 94bps.

"Heading Towards A Minsky Moment?. After the option expiry that took place yesterday, credit indices were once again “free to trade”. After being pinned at 55bps during a couple of days, iTraxx Main was on the move today after some macro news weighted on investors’ sentiment. In the morning, the Spanish government announced that they will move forward with the process of suspending the powers of the Catalan administration after regional President Carlos Puigdemont refused to shelve his claim to independence. It has to be said that it was the base-case scenario of many investors, as evidenced by the resilience of Spanish government bonds which only widened a few basis points over bunds. So, even it contributed to credit indices widening, the main cause was probably to be found in the comment regarding leverage ratios and assets’valuation made by PBOC governor’s at an event on the side-lines of the 19th Communist Party Congress in Beijing. ""If we’re too optimistic when things go smoothly, tensions build up, which could lead to a sharp correction, what we call a Minsky Moment. That’s what we should particularly defend against."" It seems it was enough to dent investors’ confidence a little on the 30th anniversary of Black Monday.

"Same Old, Same Old…. When you comment financial markets at the moment, the risk of sounding like a broken record is real. There is currently nothing stopping Stockzilla, and it is relentlessly dragging risky assets higher across the board. While the S&P; reached a new record high today, credit indices closed at their tightest levels for the new series… again. Yesterday’s blip now seems a distant memory, and except lamenting on the lack of volatility, one could also be tempted to comment on NSANY ( Nissan Motor Co Ltd ) which was today in the news for all the wrong reasons, even if it sounded all too familiar. It is both another example of a scandal hitting a Japanese corporate – we have heard of the woes of KOBSTL ( Kobe Steel, Ltd ) a few weeks ago – and another example of a scandal hitting a car manufacturer – today we also heard that the office of BMW had been raided this week by EU watchdogs as part of a cartel investigation -. Uncertified technicians have conducted vehicle inspections, even after a previous disclosure of the practise led to a major recall. Production will be suspended at all the company’s Japanese factories until further notice. NSANY’s 5-year risk premium is still a meagre 43bps, but that is twice its level 3 weeks ago.

"The End Of Hunger Bonds?. One of the most profitable trade in Emerging Markets debt over the past two decades has been to invest in Venezuelan bonds, which have yielded over 9 percent per year on average. While the collapse in crude oil prices deepened the woes of an ill-prepared Venezuelan economy and triggered a humanitarian crisis, President Nicolas Maduro, like his predecessor Hugo Chavez, has been determined to meet all foreign bond payments, going as far as cutting imports to free up hard currency. It eventually led to the coining of a new term for Venezuela’s debt: hunger bonds. But that might all come to an end in the coming days, when two payments totalling roughly $2Bln come in quick succession. The country has already fallen behind on interest payments worth $350mln that were due earlier in the month, and did not trigger a credit event yet only because they have a grace period, which is effectively an additional number of days (30 in this very instance) given to work out technical glitches and deliver the cash. For a while, there has been a broad consensus in the credit market that Venezuela was going to default at some point down the road. The time may just be about to come. Even though it stands at 75%, the 1-year default probability of Venezuela could prove a bit optimistic.

"A Century Old Relationship Ends In Tears. WHR ( Whirlpool Corporation ) got punished today for missing analysts’ forecasts with third quarter profits. Despite sales rising to $5.42bln – up from $5.24bln last year -, earnings per share fell short 7cts short of expectations at $3.83. The company also lowered its full year projection to $13.6 to $13.9, down from $15. The outlook for the full year 2017 renewed concerns that WHR struggles to integrate Indesit SpA - in which it bought a majority stake roughly 3 years ago – and cannot keep its costs in check. To add insult to injury, it also emerged that Sears has decided to end a century-long partnership and will stop stocking products from Maytag, KitchenAid and Jenn-Air. The retailer balked at paying WHR higher prices, arguing that it would no longer be able to sell Whirlpool products at a competitive price if it acquiesced to the latest demands from the white good maker. WHR’s stock took a bath and was down 10%, while its 5-year risk premium shot up 7bps to 70bps.

"Unmovable. Since the day the new series of indices were launched on the 20th September 2017, the quoted value of the roll between series 28 and series 29 of CDX IG has been very stable. The risk premium differential you have to pay to move a position from series 28 to the now more liquid series 29 has traded between 2.5bps and 3.25bps. That difference in risk premium comes from the different maturities of the series (dec22 for series 29 and jun22 for series 28) and from the composition discrepancies between the series. If one can reasonably assume that the portion of the roll compensating for the 6-month maturity extension has not moved much during the past 5 weeks, the same cannot be said for the portion corresponding to the composition mismatches. TSO (Andeavor) and RCL (Royal Carribean Cruises) are in series 29, and, since the 20th September, their combined risk premium tightened by 22bps. SPLS (Staples) and NBR (Nabors Industries) are in series 28 and, during the same period, their combined risk premium increased by 240bps. The CDX IG roll was first quoted at 2.75bps and closed today at 2.75bps, while its fair value – ie the value computed using the prices of the individual constituents of each index – has gone from 3.9bps to 1.6bps tonight. If you want to buy protection on SPLS and NBR, do not bother trading single name CDS. It is cheaper to simply sell the CDX IG roll!

"Scary Munis. That MBIA is still standing is quite astonishing. As one of the largest providers of insurance asset- and mortgage-backed securities, it was among the most vulnerable companies when the US housing market imploded in 2007. To stabilize its financial position, it had to eventually split its municipal bond insurance business off into an independent subsidiary, National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation, from the riskier MBIA Insurance Corporation which provides global structured finance products and non-US public financial guarantees. Because of the massive burden the subprime mortgage-backed security implosion imposed on MBIA Insurance Corporation, it has been seen for a long while as the riskiest part of MBIA and its risk premium has since the great financial crisis traded at much wider levels than the risk premium of the whole of MBIA. With the problems faced by the City of Hartford which sounded the first alarm bells and more recently with the crisis facing Puerto Rico, investors have had to reassess their appreciation of the risk of insuring municipalities’ debt. Since late September, not only has MBIA’s risk premium caught up with MBIA Insurance Corporation’s risk premium, it is now trading at substantially more discounted levels. From roughly 350bps cheaper (300bps vs 650bps), it is currently 100bps more expensive (1101bps vs 1002bps).
"
"Kudos To Mr Draghi. “Kudos to Mr Draghi” is probably what many investors are tempted to say. At least those who are long risky assets around the world, but most particularly in Europe. Markets had been a bit hesitant ahead of Thursday, as the way the ECB would handle the monetary stimulus reduction was not a foregone conclusion. While Mr Draghi said the ECB will reduce the size of its monthly bond purchases (to €30bln for another 9 months beginning next January from the current €60Bln), much emphasis was put on the need to tread carefully. He maintained his pledge to continue buying beyond the current deadline and/or to increase the size of the program if needed. A very warm welcome was paid to what was some called “QE Infinity”. The risk premia of both CDX IG and iTraxx Main (ITXEB), the American and European investment grade credit benchmarks, rallied since the 26th October. But the most striking is the outperformance of ITXEB compared with its US equivalent. From being 3bps wider on the 20th October, ITXEB is now today 2bps tighter (at 51bps vs 53 for CDX IG).
"
"In The Spirit Of Halloween. With U.S. steel prices having recovered about 70% from the lows reached in late 2015, investors were not really prepared for disappointing AKS’s ( AK Steel Corporation ) earnings when it reported in the morning. With hot-rolled coil steel trading at an attractive $600 per unit and Section 232 threats diminishing import competition, the company grew sales 3% year over year, but it lost money (3cts per share) nevertheless. Indeed, rising commodity prices also have a drawback, they make input more expensive. According to AKS, “higher raw-material costs, particularly for scraps, chrome, zinc and other alloys, contributed to the decline in results compared to the third quarter a year ago.” Investors were also spooked by the prospects of weakening demand in the fourth quarter, an issue that cannot be fixed by federally imposed tariffs. Both the stock (down 21%) and the 5-year risk premium (up 80bps at 460bps) of AKS got punished. With X ( United States Steel Corporation ) reporting tonight, we should know soon enough whether a second weak spot (after the retailers) is appearing in CDX HY. Scary prospects for Halloween...
"
"Catching A Falling Knife. The violent move tighter that we witnessed on European credit indices slowed a little today. They were tighter across the board, but the daily variations were fairly minimal after they began to leak wider in the afternoon. The same could not be said for single name reference entities though, and more specifically financial reference entities. They all saw their risk premia continue to collapse. With part of continental Europe closed, volumes were not sky high, but there was a proper sense of capitulation among investors holding protection. As one of the CDS market makers put it, the tone was “hideously strong”. The risk premia of Italian banks led the way – they are still riding the wave of Italy’s rating upgrade by S&P; last Friday - and bids for protection on the whole peripheral sector were hit aggressively. But the most striking feature is coming from the core high quality names: they are back to levels last seen in 2007. The 5-year risk premia of HSBC, Allianz, ING and UBS are now all trading below 18bps.
"
"The Return Of Alpha?. Over the last few weeks, the difference between the behavior of US and Euro risk premia has been quite striking. Since the beginning of the reporting season, any attempt at widening of any risk premium of any European name following disappointing results has been met by a wall of protection selling interests. The ""Draghi put"" is driving investors to believe there will always be a buyer of last resort - the ECB - to bail them out of any dodgy position. By contrast, many US names have been put under severe pressure after their earnings fell short of investors' expectations. The dispersion is steadily increasing among the performance of US credit indices constituents, and it begins to be reflected in index bases. While the basis of iTraxx Crossover has been kept firmly in check in Europe , it begins to open up in CDX High Yield in the US.
"
"Will The Spark Come From Emerging Markets?. Investors decided that one day of consolidation is enough. After yesterday’s pause, credit indices were back on the tightening track, even though the move was not very aggressive. The strength of the cash market is still fuelling appetite for risk among investors, but there are some pockets of volatility. Today’s fireworks came from South America . Venezuela’s 1-year probability of default has been estimated higher than 70% by the market for more than a month. So when President Maduro said overnight that his country will seek to restructure its debt, it should not have come as a major surprise to anyone. The announcement is merely acknowledging that the heavy debt load for the oil exporting nation has become unsustainable amid a drop in crude output and prices , as well as financial sanctions imposed by the US. It ends a 20-year anomaly that ranked Venezuela bonds among the most profitable investments. The latter all collapsed as market participants expect the recovery to be in the low twentys – investors could end up getting 20 to 25cts for each $1 worth of bonds they own -, but it had almost no impact on other emerging market assets. Probably because the situation has been known for some time, contagion is not on the agenda… yet
"
"The Signal Reached The Credit Market. “We will realise about one third of the targeted 400mln euros of annual savings in full-year 2017 but this is at the low end of what could have been possible” said Mr Combes, the CEO of ALTICE ( Altice NV ), when he commented the results of the company last week. Cost cutting in France is proving difficult – since ALTICE bought SFR in 2014, the latter has consistently lost customers - and full year forecast for earning growth had to be guided down, despite a better than expected performance of the US business. While the stock got hammered – it was marked down roughly 20% -, ALTICE’s 5-year risk premium barely reacted last Friday. Credit investors waited until this morning to reach for protection. The news of a deal reached with Sprint Corp that will allow Altice to sell wireless service in the US using Sprint’s network was not enough to alleviate their concerns and they eventually marked Altice’s 5-year CDS 33bps wider at 299bps, cancelling out all the performance of the past 2 weeks. In a market that has performed very strongly since the September roll, Altice is one of the very few names which have seen their risk premium widen over the period.
"
"All Over The Place. Over the last few weeks, even though the market direction was for risk premia to go tighter, the reporting season and the disparity in earnings have generated a decent amount of dispersion. Today was no exception, and there were a number of underperformers of both sides of the Atlantic. In Europe, NEWLOK (New Look) caught a fair amount of attention. The company reported results for the second quarter of 2018 which were operationally much weaker than many analysts had expected, with comparable brand sales down 8.6% during the first half of the year. The results were so worrying that Brait Capital, the South African investor which owns the UK retailer, decided to value the company at 0 until some kind of turn around takes shape. NEWLOK’s 5-year risk premium was pushed 2.5pts wider – you have to pay 49pts upfront to insure NEWLOK’s debt for 5 years plus another 5pts every year -. But the company also announced that on top of securing access to a £100mln revolving credit facility, it has restruck some swaps, an operation that has generated a £11mln cashflow and should bring another £30mln over the next 3 months. It looks as if NEWLOK has ample liquidity at the moment, and has managed to buy itself some time to try and turn things around. Investors took notice and sent the 1 year risk premium 3pts tighter. On the same day, while the 5-year default probability went up 4% to 88%, the 1-year default probability went down 4% to 32%. 
"
"Towards More Stressed Bases?. The credit market has been weak over the last few sessions. Credit indices certainly needed to take a breather after their impressive march tighter, but the move was mainly driven by the behaviour of the risk premia of single entities. We have seen a few outsized moves among index constituents, and the biggest were moves wider. The above grapple has many bright red boxes -  a red box means the corresponding name has widened over the last 5 trading sessions and the brighter the bigger was the move -, and they represent as many casualties among the corporate population. In the US, the retailers are once again on the move, together with car rental companies and many others that disappointed when they reported earnings. All in all, credit default swaps referencing single entities have widened faster than indices, especially in the iTraxx Crossover and CDX High Yield universe. The basis of CDX HY – the difference between an index quoted value and its theoretical value - is at the widest it has been in a while, and the basis of iTraxx Crossover is now almost flat, while it has been chronically positive - the index protection was more expensive or wider than single name protection - throughout the summer. 
"
"Capital Increase Going Bad. On the 6th November, ASTIM ( Astaldi Spa ) - the Italian company which mainly designs, develops and operates public infrastructure and large scale civil engineering works – announced without further details that they were delaying the meeting of the board of directors for the approval of their 2017 nine months results by a week to the 14th of November. Uncertainty is not markets’ best friend and since then ASTIM’s stock dropped almost 20% and its 5-year risk premium raised 150bps to more than 1000bps. Confusion grew even more this morning when the company said it is considering a capital increase of approximately €200mln. Many people questioned its rationale. Could it be a sign that ASTIM is struggling with its refinancing plan? Is it less confident in its ability to get asset disposal away? Is its exposure to Venezuela catching up with the company? Credit investors did not wait until next week to get further details and sent ASTIM’s 5-year risk premium 13pts higher - you now have to pay 31.5pts upfront plus 500bps annually to insure ASTIM’s debt for a 5-year period -. More worryingly for the company, its 1-year risk premium was even more impacted. It ended 15pts wider at 20.5pts upfront plus 500bps running, implying a 40% probability of default over the next 12 months. ASTIM is now the second most distressed name in iTraxx Crossover, right after NewLook.
"
"Waiting For Mario?. At the European open, it seemed as if we could be in for a spell of volatility. The names which had been the weakest over the last few sessions were even weaker, and it spilled over into indices which went through their recent widest levels. But as iTraxx Crossover reached 250bps and bearishness was at its highest, High Yield stocks stabilised mid-morning. Flows on credit derivatives felt much healthier all a sudden as some profit takers stepped in and begun to sell protection on single references and on indices alike. It was enough to stop the rot on the names that felt the most toxic - for instance ASTIM (Astaldi) finished unchanged while it was 8pts wider at some stage -, but the list of laggards among index constituents still outnumbered the list of winners. At the closing bell, the fair values of European indices were still wider on the day. Indices, for their part, were tighter across the board, but at this stage it appears mainly down to the belief that the ECB will be back in the frame before we know it.
"
"Tonight Is Not Gonna Be The Big Night. If credit traded heavy for the whole session, there was certainly panic. Indices are gradually reaching the levels that proved too much to break last time they were tested – iTraxx Crossover at 250bps is what caught investors’ eyes previously -. Once again, the weakness is driven by single reference entities, but that phenomenon is mainly true for companies that are rated non-investment grade. Both in Europe and in the US, the names with the widest risk premia were put under most pressure. As far as they were concerned, investment grade companies fared much better, particularly in Europe. If you consider EDF ( Electricite de France SA ), they said yesterday that they were cutting their 2018 earnings target in anticipation of weaker French demand, lower nuclear plants availability and a drop in so called capacity compensation in the UK – it refers to payments utilities receive for keeping generators open to cover supply gaps during peak demand-. The number revision, which follows a cut last month to the company’s 2017 forecasts, sent EDF’s stock 10% lower. By contrast, the reaction of the 5-year CDS was very muted. It widened 5bps since the beginning of the week, and closed tonight at 56bps. That is roughly half the level at which it was trading 6 month ago. Difficult to talk about stress…
"
"When Technicals Drive The Market. Today was a pretty choppy session on credit indices, especially in Europe. The morning was really weak as the earning call of ASTIM (Astaldi) went down very poorly with investors. That name was indicated 15pts wider during the first exchanges, and it put pressure on the whole iTraxx Crossover complex. The index seemed then on its way to breach 260 and was dangerously close to the 262.5bps level, an important strike for options that were maturing today. Indeed, market makers were net sellers of options struck at that level and had to buy protection to hedge themselves, adding to the market momentum. But the widening stalled during the morning – sellers of protection eventually surfaced, enticed by the extra 30bps that were on offer compared with the tightest levels reached this month – and in the afternoon it became obvious that the (in)famous 262.5bps would not be breached, forcing option market makers to sell the protection they had bought earlier in the day. So much so, that iTraxx Crossover closed almost unchanged to conclude a very technical session.
"
"Can't Move It. As recently as September, GKNLN ( GKN Plc ) said that Kevin Cummings, who has led GKNLN’s aerospace division for almost four years, would be handed the top post at the company and would become its next Chief Executive. It is fair to say that the market was taken by surprise this morning by the announcement that he had left the company six weeks before he even took the job. At the same time, the company revealed that further write-offs at North  American plants making parts for Airbus, helicopter producer Sikorsky and Honda Motor’s new business jet arm would be made and could total as much as GBP130mln. The whole story comes a few weeks after a profit warning that was partly explained by the weak performance at the aerospace division. The abrupt departure unsurprisingly fueled real concerns about more skeletons in the company's North American aerospace closet. But while the stock reached a 16-month intraday low and closed almost 5% lower, the 5-year risk premium of GKNLN, which was initially marked 10bps wider, ended the session a mere 3bps wider at 103bps, still a good distance away from the 188bps level it reached in June 2016. In Europe, any credit which is not distressed seems unmovable at the moment
"
"That Means Stress. This week marked the return of volatility in the credit market, at least on a micro point of view. Indices had their up and downs but the moves were always contained. Peak to trough variations of 15bps – and we have to look at intraday prints to get a double-digit number as daily closes always seem to attract contravariant investors who bring daily moves in check – at best qualify for tempest in a teacup. The real action took place at the single names level, especially in the European high- yield universe. A few corporates have consistently been the focal point of the credit market. ASTIM (Astaldi), ALTICE, SFR, BOPRLN (Boporan) experienced roller coaster rides and they are all closing the week at their recent widest levels. Investors have real concerns about them, and there was a genuine appetite for protection on these names during both the up and downs of the market as a whole. So much so that for the first time in while, the basis of iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX), the index to which they all belong, stayed negative – ie the quoted risk premium of ITXEX was tighter than the sum of the risk premia of its constituents – throughout the whole period. It is what you would expect when ITXEX tightens - indices tend to react faster than single names -, but it is quite unusual when it widens. It is a sign of genuine stress.
"
"Time For Carry Hunting?. If today’s session is any guide, the most interesting thing to get your teeth stuck into this week is likely to be the turkey on Thanksgiving next Thursday. Credit indices tried to open wider on the back of the difficulties Mrs Merkel is experiencing to form a government in Germany. But as the euro early weakness was rapidly corrected, credit was prompt to rally as well and indices were soon back to where they were trading on Friday. They eventually spent most of the session in a narrow trading range, a tad below Friday’s closing levels. It looks as if ALTICE’s management managed to stop the rot for the time being, while ASTIM (Astialdi) also stabilised. It allowed the market to cool off following the turbulences triggered by companies earning last week. Coupled with a shortened week in the US, it was enough to bring volatility sellers to the market and option premia cheapened. It looks quite likely that the next few sessions will see an emphasis on strategies providing enhanced carry between now and the end of the year.
"
"Life Outside CrossOver. It was another firm session as the Thanksgiving rally continues. The wides of 55bps on iTraxx Main and 258bps on iTraxx Crossover seem now a distant memory. But if protection felt well offered on credit indices, there are still individual names on which the investors community is still skewed towards buying protection. If these names are index members, and more specifically members of iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX), then arbitrageurs who use the strength of the index to sell single name CDS are a source of protection. They have helped cap the widening, and names like Altice, SFR, Matalan, CareUK, Loxam are all trading off their recent widest levels. The situation is slightly different for names that for any reason have been dropped from indices. It is the case for RALFP ( Rallye SA ) which exited ITXEX since COFP ( Casino Guichard Perrachon SA ) entered it. RALFP is on a widening trend, and there is nothing to stop it at the moment. Its risk premium has been catching up with the move in Casino’s stock price which currently sits below €48. RALFP’s 5-year CDS lives its own life outside ITXEX and could experience more pain going forward as year-end amplifies liquidity issues.
"
"Better Off Without It. The week developed in understandably low volumes given the US holidays, but energy got some decent airtime in Europe. On the one hand, CNALN’s ( Centrica Plc ) risk premium was sent to its widest levels since June after it warned on profits on Thursday. On the other hand, the bearish momemtun on EDF’s ( Electricite de France SA ) 5-year CDS appeared to stall a little bit. Mr Hulot, the French minister for the ecological transition, wondered whether the structure of EDF was the best possible to face the challenges of the 21st century. Investors interpreted it as a sign that the French government could be considering spinning off the nuclear activities – which are potentially a source of large liability - into a standalone unit. The operation would be reminiscent of the move undertaken by RWE in 2016. At the time, the German electricity company, facing the programmed exit of nuclear energy in its country, decided to create a new quoted entity, Innogy, to take care of electricity distribution and renewable energies.
"
"QE Impact. Until last week, the ECB had been buying bonds issued by GLENLN ( Glencore Plc ) under its Corporate Sector Purchase Program, in which the central bank purchases the debt of investment grade companies as part of its quantitative easing strategy. In September, the commodity house moved the domicile of its bond-issuing entity from Luxembourg to Jersey, taking it outside the euro-area and making it ineligible for the CSPP. While the ECB had previously announced that it would not be forced to sell bonds if a company’s rating fell below investment grade, it had not commented on what would happen if a company changed its domicile. Now we know. A spokesman told the FT today that “the Eurosystem decided to sell its GLENLN holdings purchased under the CSPP because these bonds had lost their eligibility due to the re-domiciliation of the issuer to a non-euro area country”. If it does not disclose the size of its individual holdings of debt from different companies, the ECB publishes the list of their ISINs, which are unique identifiers for each bond. While the list published regarding the week ending November 17 showed that the ECB held five of GLENLN’s bonds, the data related to the week ending November 24 included none. It might go a long way in explaining the underperformance since November 15 of GLENLN’s 5-year CDS compared to the 5-year CDS of AALLN (Anglo American Plc) and of MTNA ( ArcelorMittal SA ) which are usually very closely correlated. Since then, GLENLN’s 5-year risk premium was almost unchanged (it went from 134bps to 131bps), while AALLN’s was 11bps tighter at 124bps and MTNA’s 13bps tighter at 133bps.
"
"Decompression. The market certainly felt strong today. The tone was set by US equities which are showing absolutely no sign of fatigue. Credit indices are somehow following the same pattern, despite a clear lack of market participation. Indeed, volumes were in line with those seen around Thanksgiving. Credit indices all participated in the move, including iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX), which benefitted from the results of PIZEXP (Pizza Express). The latter were less catastrophic than people had feared, and the company’s 5-year risk premium was 200bps tighter on the day. But if you take a few steps back, it has recently been a rare occurrence. If all other European credit indices are back to their tightest levels, ITXEX is still some 10bps away from them. Despite a few positive stories in the recent past – like yesterday’s orphaning rumours surrounding NovaFives -, some of its constituents have been put under severe pressure over the last few weeks and are struggling to recover. The appetite for protection of names like NewLook, Astaldi, Altice or SFR to name a few has not been satiated and their bid shows no sign of fading.
"
"Is Liberty A Step Closer?. It was another strong session in European credit, and particularly in the Crossover space. The sentiment was positive from the word “go” on the back of the strong end to the US session, but the market gained momentum as a string of positive news benefitted a number of single name corporates. There were headlines in the press that Liberty Global would be working on a potential disposal of UPC Switzerland and UPC Austria, its operations in the two countries where Vodafone does not operate. These assets would play no role in the potential merger between Vodafone and UPC, which would seek massive cost savings and strategic advantages by combining mobile and fixed-line networks. Selling them would leave UPC with only Central and Eastern European assets in Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Romania and Slovenia. Some investors view it as a further effort in a series of manoeuvres aimed at making the two companies’ networks a better fit for each other, increasing the odd of a merger. They marked the risk premia of all the companies belonging to the Liberty Media complex tighter: VMED (Virgin Media) was 11bps at 188bps, ZIGGO was 10bps tighter at 169bps, UNITY (Unity Media) was 9bps tighter at 129bps and UPC was 20bps tighter at 155bps.
"
"Ready For An e-Fight?. Retailers have been battered for months. Investors have grown pessimistic on the sector after Amazon.com Inc pushed into that fiercely competitive industry when it acquired Whole Food Market Inc this summer. But it looks as if retailers are trying to put their act together. Earlier in the week, COFP ( Casino Guichard Perrachon SA ) announced a partnership with UK online grocery specialist Ocado, in an effort to accelerate their foray in the e-commerce area. The venture will include the construction of a state of the art automated warehouse near Paris, and will aim at leveraging Ocado’s expertise in delivery and real-time client data management. The companies want to compete with Amazon’s Prime Now solution with a view to deliver food as quickly as possible to their clients’ door steps. The initiative was rewarded with a 11bps tightening COFP’s 5-year risk premium – which was no mean feat given its recent  upward trajectory -, but the main beneficiary was RALFP ( Rallye SA ). It is effectively a leveraged play on COFP, and it saw its 5-year risk premium tightened 80bps to 639bps.
"
"Derail Me If You Can. The credit market was surprisingly firm throughout the morning. It seemed that the traditional relationship with equities had completely broken down, and despite the weakness of the Eurostoxx and of broader risky assets markets, iTraxx Main (ITXEB) reached new tights at 47bps. Early afternoon, ITXEB was effectively trading at levels not seen since early November 2007. The open of the US all but confirmed the positive tone, and the Great Financial Crisis seemed a very distant memory, while the great volatility repression organised by the different central banks is a fact obvious to every market observer. Credit was set to begin December like it ended November, but then news that Mr Flynn, Mr Trump’s formal national security adviser, had pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents and said Mr Trump’s team directed talks with Russia before they entered the White House. It created a wobble and ITXEB briefly jumped to 50bps, but protection sellers very rapidly showed up and it settled at 48.5bps. In the end, it was not as bullish a start to the month as it could have been, but it will take a lot to derail the credit market in the run up to Christmas.
"
"An 800-Pound Gorilla In A Drugstore. Since Amazon acquired Whole Food Market Inc this summer, retailers have been all over the place. Take SPLS (Staples) for instance. Even if its 5-year risk premium is off its widest level at 644bps – it traded above 800bps a few weeks ago -, it has still risen more than threefold since the beginning of the year. The foray in food-retailing could only be the first step of a much more ambitious plan though. The internet giant has applied for licenses to become a wholesale drugs distributor. It is probably one of the reasons CVS ( CVS Health Corp ) decided to move for AET ( Aetna Inc ) in deal worth roughly $70Bln. The rationale is to use the US pharmacy chain’s 9,700 outlets to improve access to preventive care and cut back on some emergency room visits by AET’s members with medical coverage. The deal which comprises a stock component (30%) and a cash component (70%) will be financed with a mix of cash and debt. That prospect initially sent CVS’s risk premium 4bps wider to 70bps on Friday when it was first rumoured, but it closed today at 61bps. The transaction had been anticipated and some investors were happy to book profit on their short risk positions on a name that was trading at 50bps five weeks ago.

"The Fall Of Sky’s Risk Premium. According to press reports, a deal between DIS ( Walt Disney Co ) and 21st Century Fox could be announced as early as next week. The deal would be worth north of $60Bln on an enterprise value basis and include Fox’s studio, some of its television networks, regional sport networks as well as its stakes in Hulu, Star India and SKYLN ( Sky Plc ). Fox has also been in talks with CMCSA ( Comcast Corporation ) regarding assets sale, but DIS is seen as a better strategic fit with less regulatory hurdles. Given the unexpected roadblock antitrust regulators put in front of the AT&T-Time; Warner deal, selling assets to DIS seems like the safest road ahead for Fox and the Murdoch family. As part of the deal, DIS is said to be interested in owning all of SKY, which, given Fox’s 39% stake, would only make the company comply with the UK Takeover Panel rules which effectively compel DIS to make an offer for the remaining 61%. With DIS’s 5-year risk premium trading between 30 and 35bps, investors considered 60bps was far too high for SKY’s and they sent it 16bps tighter to 46bps over the last two trading sessions.
"
"GVC Gambles On Ladbrokes. Today’s session was all about LADLN ( Ladbrokes Coral Group Plc). Its 5-year CDS finished the day 79bps tighter to close at 146bps. Months of speculation around a possible takeover by GVC eventually ended with the company offering 160.9p a share in cash and stocks. The deal will also include Contingent Value Right loan note which could be worth up to an extra 42.8p per share. It will depend on the outcome of the British government’s review on Fixed-odds betting terminals. The upshot of this clause is that the much-feared conclusion is now far less relevant to LADLN’s fortunes than it was before. Because of this uncertainty, LADLN had so far drawn a large short base, and there was obviously capitulation among them. Analysts believe the new combined entity could be BBB-/BB+ rated and could therefore trade in the 120/140bps area. However, the wildcard here is that LADLN’s debt gets taken out and the entity orphaned. In which case, its CDS could experience another large leg tighter.
"
"Boardroom Unrest. Today was a slow session as far as credit derivatives were concerned. Credit indices traded sideways, and the same was true was most single names. XRX ( Xerox Corp ) was one of the very few entities that sparked investors’ interest. Back in 2016, Carl Icahn convinced it to break up. The document technology business, including printer and copiers, became XRX and separated from the business processing outsourcing division, which became Conduent Inc. A follow-on settlement was reached with the nomination of one of Mr Icahn’s deputies, Mr Christodoro, to XRX’s board. However, the truce was called off today. Mr Christodoro resigned from his position, and will seek to be renominated along with three other Icahn backed dissident candidates at XRX’s 2018 annual meeting due in a few months. The intentions of the activist investor are not known, but it is possible that he wants XRX to sell itself now that it has been independent from Conduent for more than a year. He could also push it to divest assets and raise funds for share buy-backs. In any case, more leverage is a distinct possibility. XRX’s 5-year risk premium jumped by 16bps to 180bps. It is not back to the 230bps level at which it was traded 4 weeks ago, but the recent tightening trend came to an abrupt end.
"
"Wider, But Only Just. Apathy continued to reign in the credit derivatives market ahead of the central banks’ meetings today and tomorrow. Risk premia are mired at their post crisis tights on both sides of the Atlantic. While there is obviously a lot of focus on the Fed in the interest rates market leading up to the statement which will be released later today, there was not much interest in creditland on the potential implications of the US tax reform on the Fed policy, or consequences of higher dots to December 2018 than the market is currently pricing. In fact, most of the activity took place following media reports that President Sergio Mattarella will dissolve parliament by the end of the month to allow elections to be held in Italy on March 4, bringing worries about a victory of the Five Star Movement to the fore. The yield of Italian 10-year government bonds jumped 9bps compared to the yield of their German equivalent, and Italian financial institutions all saw their risk premia pushed wider. The 5-year CDS of Unicredit, Generali, Intesa and Mediobanca all ended the session weaker amid concerns about further political turbulence down the road, but it all took place in a very orderly fashion and daily variations were contained.
"
"R.I.P. CDX IG Series 9. The credit market has begun its hibernation period, and activity has been very thin over the last few sessions. Last week, central banks’ meetings failed to deliver any shock. The Spanish elections are the only event between now and New Year’s Eve, and the market is adopting a very relaxed approach towards their results. Recent polls have been too close to call, but, irrespective of the outcome, investors do not seem to expect a unilateral declaration of independence. Despite a few credit stories –M&A; activity with Disney buying assets from Fox or Thales buying Gemalto; Newlook bordering on default following the debacle of Steinhof which impacts its South African owners -, the bulk of the activity consisted in position squaring, which led to index protection selling as bleeding negative carry until the New Year seems an unbearable thought to many. We shall see next year if it was a wise thing to do. Finally, for those who have been following the CDS market for a few years, we had to mention that CDX IG Series 9 10Y, which was the instrument of choice of the infamous London Whale, is maturing tomorrow. Arbitragers now fighting to capture a few cents will remember fondly the 1.8% discount at which this index was trading compared to its fair value at the end of 2011.
On that note, the teams of DataGrapple and Hellebore Technologies wish you a very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!

"
"Less Uncertainty For SFR?. A number of changes were announced last night in the Altice sphere. As a reminder, Altice NV – which is 44.9% owned by Patrick Drahi’s Next investment vehicle - is the top holding company, and owns stakes in the various Altice entities. Its 67.2% stake in Altice USA will be spun off, and simultaneously Altice USA will pay a $1.5Bln dividend, funded by debt issued by the US operating company. Altice NV will hence get a roughly €900mln windfall. Within Europe, Altice is forming Altice Pay TV, which will hold the content that the group has recently invested in or won rights to. This content will be transferred from Altice International. SFR will cancel its existing wholesale pay TV contracts for this content, and will become a customer of Altice Pay TV, with a new revenue sharing contract and “significantly” reduced minimum guarantee, in exchange for a €300mln break-up fee. This reads as positive for SFR as it suggests less downside regarding the upcoming Champions League content, and investors initially sent SFR’s 5-year risk premium 25bps tighter at 335bps. Altice’s also benefitted during the first exchanges, and its 5-year CDS was also 25bps tighter at 390bps. But as the day wore on, people effectively focused on the step back the whole move represents from ambitions to create a global group with scale efficiencies, and both credits closed the session slightly wider on the day. As you can see on the above grapple, the trajectories of SFR’s and Altice’s risk premia are still far from reintegrating the cohort of their Communications European peers they left two months and a half ago.
"
"Happy New Year. First, let the teams of Datagrapple and Hellebore Technologies wish you and your loved ones a Happy New Year!
The blog session is back following its Christmas break, but our machines have kept crunching numbers, and our time series have kept accruing in the meantime. So far the first few sessions of 2018 have been a turbo charged version of 2017, and risky assets have been reaching new highs. Credit was not left out, and the current series of all indices are trading at their tightest levels, with the exception of iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX). During the last few months of last year, ITXEX had underperformed other European indices on the back of the poor behaviour of a number of its constituents. It was playing catch up since early January, but it unravelled today. Indeed, NEWLOK (New Look) got battered after it was reported in the week-end press that credit insurers would have withdrawn cover to many of the clothes retailer’s supplier. The move certainly reminded some investors of what happened to Toys R Us, and they sent NEWLOK’s 5-year CDS 15pts wider. To insure €1 of the company’s debt against default, it now costs 75cts upfront plus 5cts per year. That alone explained the 2.5bps underperformance of ITXEX compared with iTraxx Main today.

"
"Interest Rate Tailwind. All the rage in the market since the beginning of the year has been about interest rates. The upward move of US interest rates in particular got even more focus since the beginning of the week as the 10Y broke through the 2.5% level. Interest rate curves are also steeper across the board, and investors reacted pretty swiftly. Assuming banks should benefit from that move, they made them the best performing group among stocks on both sides of the Atlantic. They also pushed banks’ risk premia tighter, but the move was a tad slower to get started. That said, it gained momentum today, and Financials were clearly the out-performers in Europe, as you can see in the above grapple. If you click on the bar corresponding to Financials, you will also notice that Italian institutions have been by far the biggest winners today. Indeed, they also benefited from the overnight news that 5-star’s leader is dialling down significantly his anti-euro rhetoric, potentially making the Italian elections outcome slightly less disruptive.
"
"More Leverage Is Not A Necessity. XRX ( Xerox Corp ) is a BBB- rated company, which has been in the line of fire of Carl Icahn since 2016. Each time his name was mentioned, it was associated with more leverage, and the company’s risk premium was pushed wider. This time was different though. The activist’s pressure to unlock value for equity holders, could lead to a deal with Fujifilm Holdings Corp. XRX and Fuji already have a joint venture based in the Asia-Pacific region. According to overnight press reports, the two companies are discussing various possible transactions, that may or may not include a change of control of Xerox. Even though a full takeover of XRX is not on the table, the perspective of a deeper tie-up with a AA- rated company was enough for some investors to cut short risk positions they had accumulated. XRX’s 5-year CDS snapped 41bps tighter to 118bps.

 
"
"Wider and Steeper. The primary calendar has been reasonably busy since the start of the year. In Europe, it looks as if investment bankers have been putting a particular effort in bringing deals in the High Yield space since the beginning of the week. SELNSW (Selecta Group BV) - which operates coffee, drink and snack vending machines – and MTNLN (Matalan) – the out-of-town clothes retailer which trades from locations in the UK – both announced plans to refinance their current debt stacks. SELNSW will issue a total of €1.3Bln in a 4-tranch deal denominated in euros, Swedish Kronas and Swiss Francs maturing in 6 years. MTNLN will issue £480mln split between 5-year and 6-year bonds. There had been fears that CDS currently referencing the issuing entities of both companies could be orphaned in the future. But MTNLN and SELNSW decided to issue out of their current boxes. It had the same impact on both names. With the prospect of deliverables into the CDS for longer, their 5-year risk premia went wider (roughly +2pts upfront). But at the same time, because short term default does not appear any more likely for any of them, their 1-year / 5-year curves steepened by an equivalent amount.
"
"Being A Leveraged Play Can Hurt. Today was a busy session for French retailers. CAFP ( CArrefour ) released results which were not a market moving event. They only confirmed what we already knew: 2017 was difficult, but that was in the price. It was a different story for COFP ( Casino Guichard Perrachon SA ) which also posted fourth quarter numbers. The early indication of the full year group EBIT was in line with the company’s guidance (up 20% to €1,240mln), but the quality of the result in France was weaker than expected, on the back of a weaker fourth quarter performance in hypers and Monoprix in textiles, additional investment to recruit new, loyal customers to secure market shares, and because of additional costs related to a “big data” monetisation project launched in the third quarter. The message delivered to investors was a rather negative one, notably because it missed the France Retail EBIT guidance which management had qualitatively upgraded during the first half of 2017. The 5-year risk premium of COFP was pushed 4bps wider to 159bps, but its stock ended 5% lower on the day. This fall was undoubtedly the driver of the 43bps widening of RALFP’s ( Rallye SA ) 5-year risk premium to 732bps.
"
"Taxing Times. Over the last few sessions, despite stocks continuing their march higher, credit has been observing a pause. Credit indices have stabilized and traded in a very narrow range in Europe and started a slight drift wider in the US. Obviously, the increase in interest rates played a part in calming the indiscriminate buying that took place on credit instruments at the beginning of the year. But people were also mentioning the tax reform as a potential contributing factor to this newfound caution. For years, the likes of Apple and Microsoft have stashed billions of dollars offshore to slash their US tax bills. Now the rewrite of the tax code could throw that into reverse. If these corporates begin to repatriate money to fund share buy-backs or pay dividends, they could start to lighten up on their massive US treasuries and US investment grade corporate bonds inventory. They could let them mature or sell out. Because the size of their holdings is staggering, it might have given some investors food for thoughts. It is only a technical aspect, but it sometimes dwarfs fundamentals. It is quite possible that some clients looked at hedgeless portofolios and begun to protect them a little with some CDX IG purchases.  
"
"A Good Equity Fix. Credit is still finding it incredibly hardly to widen at the moment. Since the beginning of the week, it was helped by equities continuing their march higher and news that the US senate voted to end the Government shutdown (even if it has to be said that news of the shutdown did not really put any kind of pressure on credit last Friday). The same is true at a micro level, and most corporates saw their risk premia tighten over the last couple of days. In the investment grade universe, one name stood out though. FE ( CArrefour ) was the biggest mover. Its stock jumped 10% on the back of a $2.5Bln equity investment by a group including Elliott Management Corp, Bluescape, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, and Zimmer Partners. This cash injection will be used to reduce FE’s debt by roughly $1.5Bln which should clearly be credit positive. Additionally, they are forming a “restructuring working group” that will try to expedite the exit from the merchant generation business and get FE to the point where it is a fully regulated utility. FE’s 5-year risk premium moved 12bps tighter on the back of these headlines since yesterday and traded actively from 77bps to 65bps.
"
"Cheap And Getting Cheaper. Like during most sessions since the beginning of the year, credit indices have spent the day in very narrow trading ranges. For instance, iTraxx Main (ITXEB) traded between 43.25bps and 44bps today (and between 43bps and 45.5bps since January 1st). The price action has been very consistent throughout January, with a steady stream of protection selling by clients particularly in the investment grade universe. In Europe, while credits belonging to the high yield space have been mixed, CDS referencing high quality corporates and financial institutions have felt extremely well offered. There is currently no appetite whatsoever to protect individual line items in portfolios. The presence of the ECB, which keeps mopping up bonds, is everybody’s insurance against volatility. We are now in the unusual situation where ITXEB is trading at its tightest level since late 2007, but is still cheaper than its constituents. It is cheaper today to buy protection on all the individual members of ITXEB than to buy protection using the index. Doing so, you can save 1bp (or 5cts in cash price on the 5-year index) and that discount has been rising steadily since late December.
"
"Compression/Decompression. Since the beginning of the year, credit indices have been trading in very narrow ranges. But while the market felt uneventful as a whole, the price action was different from one index to the other and both compression and decompression were at play. Most market participants lament about the lack of interest in buying protection on the highest quality credits. That indeed translated into a 2bps tightening of iTraxx Main (ITXEB) over the last month, even though late December’s risk premia’s levels were already considered as tight by many. At the same time, a number of iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) constituents are having a very hard time rallying: GFKLDE (Garfunkel) and MTNLN (Matalan) are more than 150bps wider on that period, and credits belonging to the Altice sphere appear unable to move any tighter. Since last Christmas, using the 4 to 1 ratio favoured by the market to compare the 2 indices, ITXEX has underperformed ITXEB by 8bps. That is quite some decompression. In the financial universe, the tone has been very supportive. But in that space, the periphery has outperformed the core, and CDS referencing subordinated debts have outperformed CDS referencing senior debt, compounding the compression phenomenon. 
"
"The Crash Of Bombardier’s Risk Premium. On Friday, BOMB ( Bombardier, Inc ) secured an unexpected win regarding its C-series aircraft.  The company obtained a favorable ruling when the US International Trade Commission said that American industry is not being harmed by C-Series sales. It blocked a decision made last year by the US administration to impose a 300% duties on any such airplane bought by a US airline company. The dispute arose from a complaint filed by Boeing which argued that the program that led to the design of the fuel-efficient C-Series benefitted from illegal Canadian subsidies to be dumped into the US market. The ITC decision means the airplane could be flown by Delta Airlines as early as this year, allowing it to prove efficiency and reliability on routes that play to the aircrafts’ strengths. BOMB’s 5-year risk premium which got hammered when the imposition of tariffs was announced last September, was went 67bps tighter at 280bps at the close tonight. That is the tightest it has traded in more than 3 years.
"
"Highway To Hell. ASTIM’s ( Astaldi Spa ) - the Italian company which mainly designs, develops and operates public infrastructure and large scale civil engineering works – issues started in earnest last November when the company announced a 200-million euro share sale to bolster its finances after writing down about €230mln on its exposure to Venezuela. Today, investors were asked by a few investment banks if they would be interested in buying part of a €500mln revolving credit facility granted by international lenders. Distress debt traders found the news particularly worrying as it comes right after an independent business review, which Ernst and Young are said to have concluded in recent days after being brought in in place of KPMG, which are not having a good few weeks after the Carillion debacle. ASTIM’s 5-year risk premium was pushed 399bps wider at 2426bps – you have to pay 39.5cts upfront and 500bps running to protect €1 of ASTIM debt against default -
"
"Zeroing In On Zero. The broader credit market appears to be completely immune to the volatility that has affected some risky assets after the recent upwards trajectory of interest rates in the US and in Europe (the US and German 10Y yield are up roughly 30bps since the beginning of the year at 2.73% and 0.70% respectively). After a session of widening yesterday, credit indices could not help to retrace the best part of that move and were back in the middle of the range in which they have been stuck since the beginning of the year. But it does not mean that nothing goes on in the CDS market. Today the most spectacular action took place in the US, where two constituents of the CDX IG series 29 saw their risk premia tighten aggressively. XRX’s ( Xerox Corp ) 5-year CDS traded 59bps tighter at 78bps, after the company announced it will merge with a joint venture it operates with Fujifilm in Asia, marking the end of independence for a US company that became synonymous with office copy machines. PBI’s ( Pitney Bowes Inc ) 5-year CDS closed 81bps tighter at 366bps after the company released results that beat analysts’ expectations. The outperformance of these two credits was such that despite seeing its risk premium tighten by 0.5bps, CDXIG was outpaced by its theoretical value - computed using the individual risk premia of its constituents – and its basis closed almost flat. That is the smallest spread between CDXIG series 29 and its fair value since it was launched last September.
"
"The Wait Is Over. Since 2012, MTNA ( ArcelorMittal SA ), has repeatedly talked about its ambition to regain its lost investment grade status. Its battle is finally over. It has cut debt by more than half after it suspended dividends and embarked on an ambitious cost-cutting program. Today S&P; upgraded the company from BB+ to BBB-, and said that “MTNA’s credit profile has been strengthening due to its prudent balance-sheet management and the supportive conditions across its key markets”. The major scare of late 2015, early 2016 is now a distant memory. After years of tough market conditions, the world’s biggest steel producer is enjoying a rare combination of good news. Demand is strong and production from China, which has long been the cause of too much supply, is slowing as plants are being shut to cut pollution. On Wednesday, when they released their highest earnings since 2011, MTNA also mentioned their plan to bring debt down to $6Bln from $10Bln at the end of 2017, and $22Bln back in 2012. It was music to investors’ ears who sent MTNA’s 5-year risk premium down to 101bps. That is the tightest it has traded since January 2008.
"
"Is That What It Takes?. Today was the first “risk-off” session of the year in credit default swaps, with some genuine interest to buy protection. While investors were looking to buy CDS across the board in the US, they focused on the higher beta names in Europe. In fact, the risk premia of most European investment grade companies hardly moved. There was one exception though. Following press comments, VOD ( Vodafone Group plc ) confirmed that they are in early talks with Liberty Global Plc about potentially acquiring some of the cable operator’s European assets, where the companies’ businesses overlap. The two corporates have been discussing their European businesses for years, and even considered a merger at some stage but scrapped the idea in 2015 after failing to agree on a price. While investors acknowledge the potential benefit of such a transaction and sent VOD’s stock 2.5% higher at the close, they also expressed caution regarding the impact on the company’s balance sheet and pushed VOD’s 5-year risk premium 5bps wider at 61bps. Such has been the absence of volatility so far this year that it was enough to get everybody excited…
"
"What’s The Big Deal?. With the S&P500; experiencing its worst day since September 2016 on Friday, the price action in credit was unsurprisingly weak first thing this morning. As far far as FCAIM ( Fiat Chrysler Automobiles ) was concerned, the effects were compounded by articles suggesting that the company might have to pay larger than expected fines to settle the emissions-cheating lawsuit brought by the US Department of Justice. The latter would have extended a settlement offer that would include the recall of more than 100,000 vehicles and the payment of “very substantial civil penalties” which investors now estimate in the $1.6-22.2Bln range. That initially send FCAIM’s 5-year risk premium 15bps wider to almost 160bps. But after due consideration, people estimated that the sums involved should not derail the automaker’s efforts to strengthen its credit profile and cut leverage. They were actually comforted in their position later in the day when S&P; upgraded FCAIM’s credit rating from BB to BB+. The company’s 5-year CDS ended the session unchanged at 143bps.
"
"Boring Credit… Or Not?. It might not strike you when you look at the daily changes of the different credit indices, but the session was incredibly volatile. The end result is some compression in Europe between iTraxx Main (ITXEB) and iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) on the one hand, and some outperformance of ITXEB compared with CDX IG in the US. That does not tell the whole story though. If ITXEX is closing 4bps wider at 255bps, its total variation (ie the sum of the successive moves wider and tighter during the day) was well in excess of 60bps, or more than 25% of its risk premium. All that took place in very healthy volumes on indices, but activity on single reference CDS was more muted. The price action on cash products has been well behaved, and no one is desperately trying to liquidate portfolios of bonds, as opposed to what we see on equities where there appears to be some forced deleverage. There is no need yet to aggressively buy protection on single names. Credit indices theoretical risk premia are not moving that much, and despite the intraday volatility, daily variations are a bit tame when compared to other risky assets.


"
"Who Is In? Who Is Out?. The last roll was the opportunity for Markit to introduce in the series 28 of iTraxx Credit Default Swaps referencing Holding Companies rather than Operating Companies for a number of banks – it mainly impacted Swiss and UK banks included in iTraxx Main (ITXEB) and iTraxx Financials (ITXES) -. On the back of that move, CDS referencing OpCo banks have become less liquid and now trade at an even bigger discount than they probably should do compared with CDS referencing HoldCo banks. Yesterday, they announced that, from the next series onwards, ITXEB and ITXES will include CDS referencing Non-Preferred Senior debt for French banks rather than Senior Unsecured debt. That move had been discussed for a while, but its implementation date was not certain. Also, people were wondering whether Italian and Spanish banks would be included in the change. It was finally decided to wait until there is more clarity regarding MREL (Minimum Requirement for own funds and Eligible Liabilities) requirements and issuance patterns. While it was a small negative for Unicredit, Santander and BBVA which are left out from the transition for now, Markit's decision was the main driver of the outperformance of CDS referencing Credit Agricole, Société Générale and BNP – which were 2.5bps, 3bps and 3bps tighter respectively - which will soon become a less efficient hedging tool in their current form.
"
"The Week that Was. Many people are moaning about the lack of volatility, while some were feeding on it. It all came to an abrupt end this week. But while stocks experienced wild swings over the last 6 trading sessions, credit has been slower to react. At the beginning of the move, credit investors stayed on the side-lines. But as things got worse on equities, they begun to reach for the most liquid instruments and credit indices were pushed wider. Even much wider in some cases, as this week stands among the 10 worst since the Great Financial Crisis if you consider the percentage by which risk premia increased. iTraxx Main and Crossover widened by 11bps and 30bps at 56.5bps and 279bps respectively. CDX IG and CDX HY widened by 15bps and 56bps at 64.5bps and 371bps respectively. Investors did not start to sell aggressively part of their corporate bonds holdings though, and they did not even start to buy single reference Credit Default Swaps either. That led to a substantial increase in the basis of credit indices - the difference between the quoted value of an index and its theoretical value computed using the risk premia of its constituents -, and they now all stand in positive territory which is a rather usual situation. One name was not spared though. DB ( Deutsche Bank AG ), which is a poster child for leveraged institutions and is seen as much at risk in the current environment, was marked 32bps wider on the week at 103bps.
"
"The Danish Rollercoaster. TDCDC ( TDC A/S ) is one of the few remaining European telecommunication operators small enough to be easily absorbed by a rival and has long been the centre of buyout speculations. Telia AB has been seen as a likely bidder, and Apollo Global Management has circled the Danish carrier in the past. Recently, TDCDC agreed to buy Modern Times Group AB for $2.4Bln, in a move that many investors saw as a defensive measure to fend off interests. But today, after hours of speculation during which TDCDC’s risk premium was pushed around in the morning, the company eventually announced that it had agreed to be bought for $6.7Bln by a group led by Danish pension funds and Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets, and that it will walk out from its deal with MTG. Should the consortium offer succeed, a leveraged financing should follow. Even if leverage targets were less aggressive than in traditional LBO, TDCDC’s ratings should still move into high-yield territory and its 5-year risk premium ended the session 50bps wider at 148bps.
"
"That Was Not What We Expected!. In the past few days, there was a lot of hype ahead of the CPI – Consumer Price Index - number and it seems that its publication could be the main focal point every month in 2018 if this year marks the inflation comeback. There were some jitters in the credit market leading to the release, and, right after it was published higher than analysts had anticipated – at 2.1% vs 1.9% expected -, there was a moment of panic when iTraxx Main (ITXEB) and Crossover (ITXEX) touched their recent wides of 57.5bps and 286bps. But very rapidly profit takers emerged as it seems many investors cannot face the possibility of missing out on a rally, and credit decided to follow equities – which have bounced nicely off their lows on the 200-day moving average – rather than interest rates which kept marching higher – US 10Y interest rate now stands at 2.9% -. At least for now, even though credit had every chance to properly sell off, it looks as if it missed it. Every single credit index closed tighter on the day.
"
"Choice Prices? In That Market??. IJSS ( Intrum Justitia AB ) provides credit management services and solutions. It is based in Stockholm, but it has been expanding through acquisitions. It has agreed to purchase CAF SpA, one of Italy’s largest domestic loan servicers, from Lone Star Funds in December and it bought Norwegian rival Lindorff AB last year. The company is still on an expansion trail and would be looking for a partner to buy a €12Bln portfolio of bad loans from ISPIM ( Intesa Sanpaolo SpA ) at 30% of its face value. The deal would be financed with €2Bln of bank loans and about €1.5Bln of equity which would be split between ISPIM and the Swedish debt collector. As part of the transaction, IJSS would buy 51% of Intesa’s credit servicing unit, valued at roughly €500mln, and manage some of ISPIM’s existing and future non-performing loans. While some dealers were put off by the prospects of the deal, others reckoned it could easily be financed using IJSS undrawn RCF of €700mln. At the end of the day, IJSS moved in line with the broader market, but while bid/offer spreads have opened noticeably with the recent market volatility, investors had choice prices on IJSS’s 5-year CDS: sceptic dealers were bidding protection at 294bps and optimistic dealers were offering it at the very same level.

"Now We Know. If you are an equity specialist, Metro AG and Ceconomy AG are two distinct and well identified entities since the hive-down and spin-off of Metro Wholesale and Food Specialists (subsequently renamed Metro AG) out of the old Metro AG entity (currently known as Ceconomy AG) in July 2017. In the Credit Default Swaps market, the situation of contracts referencing Old Metro AG prior to the demerger – they are the ones included in iTraxx Crossover Series 28 – has only been resolved yesterday. The ISDA Determination Committee decided that these contracts will now reference Ceconomy AG rather than the New Metro AG, contrary to what some investors had been thinking. In credit jargon, there will not be any succession event. While Ceconomy does not have directly issued tradable bonds, it remains liable for the bonds issued by Metro AG and Metro Finance prior to the demerger, and the liability will remain in place until July 2022 under the German Transformation Act. These bonds, and currently only them, will be deliverable into the Old Metro AG CDS. The hope of being able to deliver New Metro AG debt (which is a Ba1/BBB- rated company) are now over, and Old Metro AG’s CDS collapsed 20bp to 72bps, their tightest level since mid-2008.

"It’s The Liquidity, Stupid. In the absence of the US, no one really expected massive volumes to go through. And that is exactly what happened with less than €5Bln notional of iTraxx Main trades reported to the SDR. That is less than half the daily volumes of last week. There were a couple a single name stories with Daimler (5-year CDS +3.5bps @ 45bps) still embroiled in the emission defeating device scandal in the US and UPC (5-year CDS +16bps @ 146bps) rumoured to eye Swiss mobile providers Salt or Sunrise. But away from that, single reference CDS were quiet and closed broadly unchanged or perhaps even tighter, as market participants prefer to cut shorts after a few weeks of volatility. This was in contrast with the weakness in stocks and credit indices. It felt like we had a big short squeeze on Thursday and Friday into the US bank holiday, and that we are now reversing part of the these moves. That led to a general widening of bases (difference between the quoted value of an index and its theoretical level computed with the value of its individual constituents) in Europe as all credit indices unperformed their fair values.

"The Amazon Effect. The take-over of Whole Foods by Amazon is still reverberating in the industry. Retailers have been under growing pressure from online competitors, and the corner drugstore has been no exception. Grocer ABS (New Albertson’s) announced today that they will buy what remains of RAD ( Rite Aid Corporation ) in a deal that will continue to reshape the US retail and health care industries, after RAD failed to sell itself to Walgreens. The resulting entity will have about 4,900 stores – including 4,350 pharmacy locations - in 38 states, and the pharmacies will be rebranded under the Rite Aid name. The planned combination is projected to have $14Bln in debt, and its debt to EBITDA leverage is expected to stand at 4.1x, higher than ABS’s 4x, but lower than RAD’s 4.5x. Most of the bonds issued by RAD are callable and investors expect them to be redeemed during the process of the merger. A lot of these bonds are currently held in portfolio where the credit element has been stripped by the purchase of Credit Default Swaps. The anticipation of these positions unwinds is probably one of the drivers of the collapse of RAD’s 5-year CDS which closed 239bps tighter at 501bps.

"Too Much Italian Risk Priced In?. Today was option expiry. Despite all the promises of volatility and exacerbated moves as large negative gamma positions were supposedly open at strikes close to current levels on most indices, the market did not live up to the hype. After a weak open, all credit indices trended tighter towards their closing levels without any acceleration at any point. The main takeaway from the session is that the recent underperformance of iTraxx Europe (ITXEB) compared with CDX IG appears to have stalled. Over the last few sessions, investors bought protection on peripheral financial institutions in a bid to protect themselves against any adverse outcome of the Italian elections on the 4th March. That pushed iTraxx Financial Senior (ITXES) to trade a couple of basis points wider than ITXEB while it was trading 1bp tighter 10 days ago. It created a bearish sentiment in Europe where ITXEB traded sideways while CDX IG moved away from its widest levels. ITXEB underperformed CDXIG by 8bps since the 9th February. Both indices traded flat to each other yesterday, which, at least temporarily, seems to mark the end of that trend. Tonight, CDXIG closed at 54bps, 2bps wider than ITXEB.

"Did I Miss One Of Kylie’s Tweets?. There was not a lot of actual news on the tape and most risky assets traded sideways. US equities even managed to creep higher as interest rates eased on both side of the Atlantic (US 10Y lost 5bps at 2.87% and German 10Y lost 5bps at 0.65%). But credit indices did not manage to shake that bearish sentiment. The weakness continued all day and they widened almost in a straight line until mid-afternoon, before stabilising within touching distance of their widest levels of the session. It appears that a few hedge flows were to blame for the continued bid for iTraxx Main CDS, as options providing downside protection expiring late March were particularly sought after. These flows are consistent with the persistent market unease regarding the Italian elections’ outcome as they cover the date of the poll which will be held on the 4th March. Unless of course they are based on one of Kylie’s tweets I may have missed saying that selling protection is “soooo last year”.

"Late Winter or Early Spring. 
  With western Europe freezing with polar air mass from Moscow, the winter is far from over. With Italy going to the polls next Sunday, the market could see another cooling weather from Roma. Italy is divide while facing many challenges. Italy credit default swap (CDS) has the largest single name open interest among single name CDS (visit OTCStreaming ). With more than 17BUSD open interest on the Isda 2014 contract, increasing by 500MUSD over the last week, more than a billion traded last week. The CDS premium is rising since the beginning of the month but it is only 10bps wider, trading in the 105-110 context. Investors are starting the week by adding risk on Italy bonds. The CDS is trading better, in line with other risky assets. The size of the open interest on the CDS could favor a short squeeze on the name, hedgers will be most likely quicker to act than long term investors. The next week-end could deliver an early spring for the CDS market.

"Shall we go shopping, old way?. Macy’s released a decent set of results, better sales and cash flows generation with property sale. Today, Macy’s is the best performer of the US investment grade index constituents, 20bps tighter. 
Staying a weak BBB, Macy’s will remain in the next investment grade series. The name is active in CDS with more than 2.3BUSD open interest (visit OTCStreaming ) 
for a 5.8BUSD total bonds’ outstanding.  We have many times grappled with retail sector poor performance. Macy’s has stopped its decent to hell. The name was trading as wide as 350bps early November 2017 
but the risk reward of a short at this level needs a continuous negative news flow. Macy’s has at least benefited from the optimism of consumers (c.f. February reading of the Conf. Board Consumer Confidence at 131, 
the highest over the last 10 years). Consumers were motivated to go shopping, online but old way as well.

Meanwhile, the credit market was well oriented with short covering. Jerome Powell testimony brought back some volatility and a last hour weakness in credit indices especially in the US.

"Quant Quake After Shock. February 2018 will be first reminded as the quant quake on VIX related products. 
  But, the credit default swap market felt the shock as well. 
  Credit default swaps investors were caught off-guard especially on the credit index swap 
  market. Investment grade indices are closing the month 25% wider - trading 
  both in the 55bps context at the end of February. 
  Most of synthetic activity took place on indices 
  (visit OTCStreaming) 
  and the indices under-performed the single names. Investors are starting to assess
   the consequence of the end of the irrational exuberance on risky assets, 
   the consequences on rising interest rates.  Looking at the month monthly
    performance of our clusters (sets of correlated CDS), the US Energy sector
	 was the largest under-performers (all bubbles should be on as straight line 
	 if CDS were moving with a beta of 1). This is similar to what happened on the equity market. The Energy sector is as well the worst performer of the SPX in February (-10%) while the following under-performer is the SPX Consumer Staples (-7%). Changing the span from 1M to YTD on the Grapple offers a quite different picture. The Energy sector was a top performer in January, it is just back in line with the overall market.  The synthetic market does not show yet a huge rotation on the rate sensitive sectors, especially the high yield issuers which are more sensitives to their forward refinancing rates.  We will have more opportunities to grapple with rotation in the months to come.

"The Tottering Titan. 
 The largest advertising group in the world, WPP Plc, released today its preliminary results for 2017 and its 2018 expectations. 
 The stock was limit down -15% in the morning. As the CEO Martin Sorrell writes in the company report, ”the major factors influencing this performance were probably the long-term impact 
 of technological disruption and more the short-term focus of zero-based budgeters, activist investors and private equity than, we believe, the suggested disintermediation of agencies by Google and Facebook
  or digital competition from consultants.”.  As reported in a former grapple in August, the same Martin Sorell was already blaming share buyback and the lack of investment in advertising.
   Today is not a day of recognition of the real challenge for WPP, a frontal fight with the new titans: Google and Facebook. For a long time, the CDS, was a “good” BBB credit. 
   With more than 800MEuros open interest (visit OTCStreaming) for more than 6BEuros outstanding debt, the CDS was active today and we shall look at the data tomorrow to confirm the interest in the synthetic market.  The 5Y CDS premium is closing 10% wider at 70bps. The European credit market is eventually  recovering  from its ECB-induced coma.

"Used CDS Servicing. 
  March 20th, the market will start trading the new vintage of credit indices, 
  Series 29 in Europe and Series 30 in the US. The maturity will be extended by 6
   months and the composition adjusted according to index rules.  In Europe, the 
   crossover is again challenging. According to the rules, many names must get out as
    their CDS premium is too tight. The synthetic community will use the index to create 
	liquidity on new reference entities. Likely,  the non-investment grade issuer Picard, 
	a well know French quality frozen food company will be added to the index.  The company has more
	 than 1BEuros of debt following 2 successive LBOs.  The company is 100 years old, it survived its
	  LBO, will it survive its CDS? Given the ‘addiction’ of the French to Picard,  there is little doubt.
	   There is more risk to have a transient CDS. It happens a lot in the high yield universe.  In the US, 
	   PHH, the mortgage servicer, announced this week its purchased by Ocwen Financial, a very weak B credit. 
	   PHH credit quality is badly negatively impacted. PHH CDS was one of these transients,
	    it was included in the US high yield indices, from vintages 18 to 26. 
		 According to OTCStreaming, there are 20BUSD of open interest on these vintages. PHH represents 1% of these indices. Investors have around 200MUSD PHH exposure induced by the indices. It was nevertheless difficult in the last few days to find a market, an indication at best, on this name. Trading new names on the market is a very good development but it should imply a servicing commitment over the next 5 years.

"It Was All About European Politics. Italy has had around 90 governments since 1900. Neither stability nor certainty has ever been the main feature of Italian politics. No one was expecting anything else than a hung parliament (a party needs 40% of the votes to avoid that) to come out of Sunday’s elections, but no one was expecting both populist parties - Five Stars and the League - to claim the right to lead the next government. The League gathering more votes (17.6%) than Forza Italia (14.1%) took everyone by surprise, and makes the centre-right look more anti-immigration and euro sceptic. Furthermore, the grand coalition between Forza Italia and the Democratic Party (which gathered 18.8% of the votes) that some had hoped for is also off the agenda as the combined share of the votes of these two is falling short of the 40% threshold. That led to a negative open in Europe. But then investors remembered that even Euro sceptic parties had softened their stance on euro exit before the elections, which, combined with the agreement of the SPD to join the CDU-CSU to form a new coalition in Germany, triggered some profit taking on short risk positions. It pushed credit indices risk premia to tighter levels compared with Friday in a straight line. At the end of the day, the only evidence that the results of the Italian elections were worse than many had thought was the underperformance of Itraxx Main in Europe compared with CDX IG in the US.
"
"Scared By The Roll. While credit indices in Europe felt relatively healthy and traded tighter across the board, it was a different story in the US. Despite a positive start after an evident lack of support for tariffs within Trump’s administration and Congress, CDX IG - the US investment grade benchmark – trended back to unchanged levels. Investors are still worried by the current valuations as a whole and by the recent spell of volatility, but, at a micro level, technicals appear to push risk premia in the opposite direction. The roll is only a fortnight away, and people are wary of owning CDS contracts referencing single name entities maturing in December 2022, aka “5-year CDS”. These contracts will lose their “on-the-run” status and their liquidity will be impaired when June 2023 becomes the new reference maturity for CDS. That is probably the reason why hardly any Dec22 CDS were quoted wider today. Even CVS ( CVS Health Corp ) which launched a $45Bln 9-tranch bond offering saw its Dec22 risk premium tighten. So much so that the basis of CDX IG – the difference between the quoted value of an index and the theoretical one computed using the values of its individual constituents - was back into positive territory – up 7.5cts (or 1.6bps) on the day - , also helped by the tightening of PBI ( Pitney Bowes Inc ) – by 54bps to 292bps - and JWN (Nordstrom, Inc) – by 23bps to 294bps - which respectively announced they had “concluded that an outright sale of the company (was) not in the long term interests of the shareholders” and that they rejected a go-private offer.
"
"Immune To Tape Bombs. Synthetic credit was re-racked wider at the open as most dealers were expecting a weak session with Gary Cohn announcing overnight he would leave the Trump administration. But if the prospect of escalating “trade wars” led to a muted start to the session, there was no real follow through and it was soon obvious that the market would shrug it off. Indeed, in a similar reaction to the seemingly negative results of the Italian election over the week-end, customers hardly sold any risk. Flows were not particularly heavy, and there was a decent amount of dispersion in risk premia’s behaviour, especially in the European Crossover space. TITIM ( Telecom Italia Spa ) outperformed once again in the wake of their numbers’ release - its 5-year CDS closed 4bps tighter at 118bps which is 10bps tighter since the beginning of the week -, while debt collectors underperformed. IJSS (Intrum Justitia AB) and GFKLDE (Garfunkel) were under pressure and closed 9bps wider at 312bps and 14bps wider at 645bps respectively, after Arrow Global Group Plc tapped some of their existing bonds at significant discounts compared with levels at which they were traded in the secondary market.
"
"Only Clear Accounting Will Do. The sector which bore the brunt of the pain yesterday was debt collection. The focus changed today and retailers were under the cosh. UK retailers were penalised by John Lewis’ profit warning even if their 5-year CDS suffered less than their equities. But the main casualty was the COFP ( Casino Guichard Perrachon SA ) / RALFP ( Rallye SA ) complex. COFP announced 2017 results that met headline guidance, but only with the help of favourable currency impact and non-recurring tax credits in Brazil, which they excluded from their 2018 guidance.  That led some analysts to consider that “COFP includes these benefits in headlines when they work in their favour”, but “exclude them when they work against them”. It is not the first time people have argued with the company for more transparency and consistency. Aggressive accounting practices are not really flavour of the day, and COFP was not given the benefit of the doubt. Its shares and RALFP’s were sent tumbling. Its 5-year risk premium was marked-up 9bps at 186bps, while RALFP’s was 54bps wider at 850bps.
"
"Normal Service Resumes. The few days during which fear gripped the market after the debacle of the short volatility funds are a distant memory. The economic numbers that came out in the US were music to equity investors’ ears: a big job number and a slight decline in wage growth. They did not think twice and sent the S&P; roaring higher. European equities had a more muted reaction, but credit did not hesitate and credit indices took a resolute leg tighter on both sides of the Atlantic. iTraxx Main closed 2bps tighter at 50bps, iTraxx Crossover 5bps tighter at 254bps, CDX IG 2bps tighter at 55bps et CDX HY 11bps tighter at 330bps. Implied volatility was for sale – it has already been the case for a few sessions in optionland to be honest - and investors holding short risk positions threw in the towel as we broke through what had been a solid trading range recently. It could pave the way for further spread tightening, especially as we head into the roll which appear to play a major role in people’s mind at the moment. Looking ahead, there does not appear to be much on the calendar in terms of risk event. It could give the market some more room to tighten and shrug off the bad memories from February.

"Simpler Is Better. Following the Fukushima disaster in 2011, the German government decided to engage on a path towards renewable energies and away from nuclear electricity.  That was one of the main reasons Innogy SE was spun off from RWE in 2016, so that it can operate as a company building and managing plants to generate power and extract energy from renewable sources, as well as retailing electricity and gas. At the time RWE kept roughly 75% of Innogy stocks, which are now part of a complex asset deal with E.ON SE which is launching a voluntary public takeover offer to Innogy’s shareholders at €40. If the deal gets regulatory approval and goes through, E.ON will become a power utility with a strong focus on regulated grid, and RWE will focus on power generation with a fully diversified generation portfolio. Even though it is not clear at the moment what will exactly happen to Innogy’s outstanding debt and thus what will happen to Innogy’s CDS contract, investors greeted the news with a tightening of both Innogy’s (-5bps at 46bps) and E.ON’s (-2bps at 42bps) risk premia. In any case, the breakup of Innogy with the allocation of different utility assets to E.ON and RWE will simplify the two utilities corporate structures, which is always a positive.
"
"Tighter Now, But Not Tomorrow. It was really obvious over the last few sessions, but even over the last few weeks it has become more and more difficult to source decent bids on 5-year CDS referencing single names. The combination of a benign calendar in terms of risk event and the coming roll has made dealers very reluctant to buy protection maturing on or before December 2022. The maturity of “on-the-run” CDS contracts (read the most liquid) will only be extended by six months to June 2023 next Tuesday, when the roll officially takes place and when new series of indices are issued, but the value of December 2022 contracts has already been impaired and they already have rolled down the curve. Longer dated protection is not really affected by this phenomenon, and remain bid as uncertainty over what the future keeps in store on the medium term is certainly here to stay. That is obvious when one looks at curves. If you consider the investment grade universe in the US and in Europe over the last month, while the risk premia of December 2022 CDS contracts have tightened, the additional premium one has to pay to extend a contract maturity to December 2027 has increased. In other words, while the risk premia of December 2022 CDS contracts have tightened, the risk premia of contracts protecting you against a default for a 5-year period but which would start in 5-year time has not changed.
"
"The Odd One Out. A dozy morning followed by a late sell-off in the afternoon appears to be the theme of late, and today was no exception. Cash is feeling heavy particularly in the financial sector. New issues in the cash market continue to come cheap and tend to reprice secondary. As bonds feel soggy, investors turn to synthetics to hedge their portfolios and they push CDS wider. Italian names underperformed further on the back of Salvini’s statement, who did not rule out including 5-star personalities to form a government. In this gloomy environment, PRUFIN ( Prudential Plc ) was the clear outperformer after it announced the partial sale of its annuity portfolio, healthy FY2017 results, and its plans to split the firm by spinning off its UK operations to create an insurance business focused on faster growth markets in Asia, Africa and the US. The demerger suggests that PRUFIN’s bond stack may reduce, which could also lower the amount of CDS deliverables. The company’s risk premium tightened aggressively after the news, even though it gave back some it gains at midday when the insurer was downgraded by Fitch. 5-year CDS contracts referencing PRUFIN’s senior debt closed 8bps tighter at 42bps, and contracts referencing subordinated debt 15bps tighter at 78bps.
"
"March Shower. The credit indices started the day on a weak tone. The Crossover index traded up to 261bps, 5bps wider than yesterday close (according to OTCStreaming) just when the US came in. The investment grade index traded up to 51.6bps. The US market brought some strength and the Crossover credit index traded back to 253bps.  Many players are waiting for the index and single names roll next week. The price action is erratic. In the meantime, it would be worth to work on the most interesting pair CDS trade: Italy 5Y CDS versus Russia 5Y CDS relative value. They are both trading around 102 and the were very close one to another over the past year. They are both at the center of the news, Italy with short term risks and Russia more medium term risks. Both CDS have the potential to be more than just a March shower.
"
"Convalescent at Best. Altice published its Q4 earnings yesterday evening. Financial and operational performances were better than expected.  
The Altice synthetic credit complex tightened scientifically today: SFR Group S.A.  was tighter by 40bps while Altice Finco S.A.was tighter 
by 25bps. Both reference entities are members the  European Crossover Index.  Altice's CDS performed better than Altice's equity, 
deleveraging stories are good music for credit investors. The company is still far from having access again to cheap funding. 
On the volume side, it is quite difficult to analyse the trading activity on Altice’s CDSs. They are not cleared by Ice (visit OTCStreaming). They are cleared only by LCH with around 100MEuros per reference entity.  This is a small amount compared to the total debt of the company, close to 50BEuros. The volumes reported by DTCC  - with a delay - are indicating that the name is quite active with around 40M daily traded volumes.  The name keeps trading over-the-counter on a bilateral basis. It deserves to be cleared by all clearers due the trading activity. The credit market focus is volatile and investors are agile.  The regulated services are always a step behind - agility and regulation are barely compatible.  Meanwhile, the credit index market was better oriented in a subdued session. A lot of market participants were crunching numbers to estimate where the index rolls will trade next week.
"
"The Mighty Roll. It was a pretty ugly session for equities, with indices roughly down 1.5% across the board. Implied volatility was also on the ascend with the infamous VIX back above 20%. Corporate bonds were also under pressure as the market had to digest more new issues that added to the recent busy calendar. It was all the more surprising to see the muted - to say the least - reaction of the synthetic market. Credit indices held very well with iTraxx Main and CDX IG only 1.5bp and 1bp wider at 51bps and 55bps respectively. Outright activity on single name CDS was light, and flows were largely limited to position squaring and investors rolling positions from December 2022 to June 2023 maturity. There was very limited need to hedge portfolios, and whatever need there was was met by people willing to take profit of short risk positions. It looks as if everyone is paralised by tomorrow’s roll and uses it as an excuse not to express any bearish view. The only name that keeps running away is COFP ( Casino Guichard Perrachon SA ), which was another 10bps wider at 255bps. Its risk premium has increased by 50% since the company released its results early March.
"
"The Roll Exposed. Today was the day the maturity of “standard” CDS is extended by 6 months. Contracts maturing in June 2023 became officially the reference for what market participants call 5-year CDS, taking over from December 2022 contracts. Data displayed on DataGrapple follow the same rule. What you now see when you click on “5Y” in the top right corner of this grapple are the risk premia of contracts maturing in June 2023, while yesterday you got the risk premia of contracts maturing in December 2022. Considering that the fair value of 5-year iTraxx Crossover series 28 hardly moved – its daily change amounted to less than 1bp tighter -, one could say that risk premia in the European High Yield universe did not change on the day. Hence today’s daily changes give a fairly accurate estimate of the risk premium difference between June 2023 and December 2022 contracts. This grapple shows you the extra premium you are asked to pay (or that you can expect to receive) to extend the maturity of a position by 6 months.
"
"Thanks, But No Thanks.. Today felt quieter than yesterday. Investors are still adjusting positions after the roll, moving some of them to the newly issued “on-the-run” contracts. Days where members of the Fed meet to decide on rates at the end of the session are never the busiest anyway. It did not prevent a few outsized moves though. The most spectacular certainly affected JWN (Nordstrom, Inc) after the company decided to end definitively its discussion with members of the Nordstrom family regarding a possible buyout deal. While the news negatively impacted the stock - it was down 2% -, it greatly benefitted the CDS which was 118bps tighter at 190bps. The latter is back to its June 2017 level, when the whole story started, after having traded as wide as 370bps. Taking a company private usually implies taking on big amount of additional debt, and credit investors are always getting nervous when the words “LBO” or “MBO” are pronounced.
"
"In A World Of Their Own. With a relatively hawkish Fed yesterday, the market started on a fairly weak note, and that tone persisted throughout the session. Overall risk markets traded poorly and equities were the most impacted, dragging credit along for the ride. But in comparison, the latter felt almost bullish, and, to some extent, some of the flows were. If credit indices closed wider across the board, sellers of volatility flocked the market. Despite the spike in VIX - which is back above 20% -, the implied volatility of options on iTraxx indices maturing in one month ended the day down 2 to 3 points, pushed lower by outright sellers and people rolling short volatility positions they hold on series 28 into series 29. So, at the end of the day, we had equities down by 2%, VIX up 3points, iTraxx Main and Crossover wider by 2 and 7bps respectively, but credit implied volatility down across the board. At some stage, some bigger hedging flows should surely materialise.
"
"Compression Is On. The US had a rough end to their trading session on Friday and risky assets took a beating after European went home for the week-end. Everyone was thus expecting a difficult open this morning when they arrived in the office. It did not really pan out that way though, and the European credit indices opened unchanged compared with their close on Friday and were soon even a tad tighter. If they eventually widened in the afternoon, they did so in a very orderly fashion, and iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) more reluctantly than other indices. It seems that there is some sort of protection buyers’ strike on ITXEX at the moment. Maybe people do not want to pay close to 300bps to own protection on it, as it is a level that we have not seen for quite a while on that index. The bottom line is that the compression trend between ITXEX and iTraxx Main which begun a few ago is still at play. The risk premium of investment grade indices is currently rising at a faster pace than the risk premium of high yield credit indices.
"
"The Day Of Reckoning? Not Yet. Following the weak close overnight in the US, European credit opened wider and saw some active long risk position covering throughout the session. The market never really recovered from it, and credit indices ended wider across the board, despite the rebound in equities. Credit did not feel great, but, given the carnage in stocks that took place after Europe left yesterday, some considered that today was a real test for the market. And relatively speaking, that move was largely shrugged off by European credit as the widening was contained. People most likely took comfort in seeing the S&P; holding to its 200-day moving average and rejecting a more punitive leg lower for the time being. Confidence is thin on the ground, but the day of reckoning might not be around the corner just yet.
"
"More Of The Same. 
  After the end of month rally we experienced on Thursday, the first day of the quarter started pretty badly in the US while Europe was enjoying its Easter break. Investors were not entirely comfortable when they arrived in their office this morning and they were expecting a rough ride. But if European credit opened a little bit wider, it did not participate in the weaker equity picture. It probably makes sense considering that FANG bore the brunt of the pain in the US, and they are not included in any credit index. CDX IG had a little scare as it is more tech heavy, but the widening was rapidly faded as soon as equity markets stabilised. As you can see if you visit OTC Streaming, volumes were a bit underwhelming and it seems that a decent chunk of the market is still absent. While US stocks continue to whip around, credit is holding in relatively well at the moment.
  
"
"So Much For Decompression. At the end of last year, the call was almost unanimous: 2018 would be the year where valuations would be challenged. Many analysts called for an underperformance of High Yield credits against investment grade credits. At the very least they said the utmost caution was warranted. By the end of January, they were all highfiving each other. They got that trend right, and iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) had underperformed iTraxx Main (ITXEB) in Europe, while CDX HY had underperformed CDX IG in the US. But if you look at the current situation, the European market tells you a different story. ITXEX series 29 – the current on the run index - trades 35.5bps wider than ITXEX series 28 – which was on the run at the beginning of the year -, and ITXEB series 29 trades 8.85bps wider than ITXEB series 28. Based on the above grapple, it means that ITXEX series 28 has widened by 20bps during the first quarter, while ITXEB series 28 has widened by 6bps. Based on the 4 ratio that the market uses as a rule of thumb to estimate compression/decompression between these 2 indices, ITXEX has effectively outperformed ITXEB since the 1st of January. I am not sure what the exact catalyst was over the last 2 months, but we certainly witnessed a reversal of the decompression trend that was at play earlier in the year.
"
"Indices Are Rich. What a rip! The tone in the credit market was strong from the word “go”. The strong overnight close in the US was due to a move that took place after Europe went home. It triggered a rally in equity markets and credit indices alike. Eurostoxx finished up 2.5%, iTraxx Main 2.5bps tighter at 57.5bps, iTraxx Crossover 7bps tighter at 283bps, CDX IG 4.5bps tighter at 62.5bps, CDX HY 19bps tighter at 349bps. In creditland, CDS referencing single entities followed suit to a certain extent, and they were tighter across the board. But it seems that recent protection buying from clients has left dealers keen to cover some long risk positions. It created some viscosity and single name CDS were a bit slower to tighten. It has been the case for a few sessions now, and it has caused indices to outperform their constituents since the beginning of the month. The credit index market is back in a configuration where bases – the difference between the quoted value of an index and its theoretical value computed with the individual prices of its constituents – are negative across the board. It is cheaper to buy protection using the indices than it is to buy single reference CDS, in the US and in Europe. Credit indices are rich compared to their fair values.

"Ultimate Credit for Ultimate Factories. Fives is a French heavy industry machinery designer, “ultimate machines, ultimate factories” is the company’s motto. The company is two centuries old. It has taken part to the design and construction of a few landmark “iron” icons like the “Pont Alexandre III” in Paris. From modern cement plants to automobile assembly lines, Fives sells turnkey heavy industry solutions. Name after Fives, a Lille's borough, the company is one of the remaining industrial jewel in a region which has lost a lot of its industries over the last 50 years. Fives was taken private and its managers are its main shareholders. The company’s managers decided to engineer the ultimate refinancing of their existing debt for 700M Euros. Paying only 5% for 7 a seven years credit is attractive for a B company. The company is using its financing entity Novafives. The CDS market was anticipating a refinancing via another route by the end of last year. While trading at 500 bps a year ago, the CDS collapse to just 100bps at the end of 2017. The widening was brutal and the CDS is back to 300bps.  Meanwhile, the CDS and credit index markets were quiet with less activity reported than usual.

"From Russia Without Much Love. Even though the magnitude of the moves of credit indices was limited, the tone was positive throughout the session as European investors decided to ignore the late US weakness when they began their day and focused instead on China’s Premier’s speech pointing to the possible reduction of some tariffs. But today was all about Russia actually. It was under severe pressure as the unprecedented nature of the sanctions announced recently reverberated through the market. The catalyst for the aggressive move wider of Russia’s 5-year risk premium was the US President’s threat to respond “forcefully” to a chemical attack in Syria. It sent the Russian ruble tumbling after multiple reports of military activity in the Mediterranean. While equity markets were having a party, the 2047 bond that Russia tapped recently at par – the deal size was increased by $2.5Bln to $7Bln three weeks ago - was down 4pts and traded as low as 93.5% before settling at 95% of par. Russia’s 5-year CDS traded up 160bps - or 20bps wider on the day – before closing at 150bps. Investors’ concerns were also obvious as they flattened Russia’s CDS curve, moving the short-dated risk premia even faster.

"What Will Elliott Do?. There are many question marks around Italy at the moment. The country is still waiting for someone to be appointed to form a government, even if it seems that Matteo Salvini of the Eurosceptic League may be asked by Italian president Sergio Mattarella to have a go next week. That uncertainty has made investors a bit cautious towards anything Italian in the recent past. The odd one out was certainly TITIM ( Telecom Italia Spa ) though. Ever since the activist fund Elliott started building a stake in the company – they now hold 9% of the company -, credit investors have been worried about the implication for the balance sheet of the company. Elliott released earlier in the week a presentation on their potential plans. Under the proposals, net leverage will be reduced to 1.9x, bringing it in line with peers. If the company achieve these targets, analysts reckon ratings could get to BBB/BBB- and as such trade at similar levels to Telefonica, whose 5-year risk premium is worth 80bps. It went a long way to allaying debt holders’ fear around Elliott’s involvement, and TITIM has been one of the best performers among high beta names in Europe. Its 5-year CDS has tightened by 10bps to 140bps over the last 3 sessions.

"Is Private Equity Coming?... Hooray! … For Once. ENFP (Bouygues SA) is rumoured to be considering a bid with other investors for ALTICE’s ( Altice NV ) struggling French unit – SFR -to consolidate the telecom market. A deal would enable ENFP to take out a key local competitor and add customers in a market where profits have been squeezed by a stiff four-way rivalry. Since Iliad introduced super cheap offerings in 2012 under the Free brand, a fierce price war has taken place. Such an operation would help ENFP close the gap in terms of subscribers with Orange SA, the main operator in France. ENFP could team up with CVC Capital Partners. Usually, rumours of private equity group entering the fray send a shiver up credit investors’ spine. But such have been the worries regarding Mr Drahi’s group in recent months which faces an exodus of customers and has to tackle a €31Bln debt pile, that disenchanted investors cheered the rumour and sent ALTICE’s 5-year risk premium 23bps tighter at 441bps and SFR’s 25bps tighter at 406bps.
"
"Four-Week Old And Not Trading. It was another strong day for Corporate and Financial synthetic credit instruments. The price action was relentlessly strong, although the pace of the tightening of risk premia does feel like it is starting to slow down a bit now. Investment grade spreads were unchanged to 3bps tighter, while high yield spreads were unchanged to 15bps tighter. There was some two-way interest on most credits and buyers of single reference CDS are no longer on strike. So much so that some arbitrage activity took place on the iTraxx Crossover index, where arbitragers bought index protection and sold single name protection. But it was confined to “off-the-run” series, as it seems the recent additions to iTraxx Crossover Series 29 have not found a clearing level yet. The market makers are still quoting wide bid-offer spreads and appear very reluctant to buy or sell risk on any of them.
"
"A Long Overdue Consolidation. Like every third Wednesday of the month, today was option expiry day in creditland. Even though iTraxx Main series 28 spent the day wrapped around 45bps, this level was not a big option “pin” – ie a strike with an important option open interest - and it did not trigger any technical trading as a result. It was a benign expiry session, even though the tone was weak for most of the day, and indices closed wider for the first time in almost two weeks. It all started yesterday afternoon after a few buy-side institutions came and took profit on some of their long risk positions on credit indices. It spilled over into today’s session. To be fair, despite equities chopping around but ultimately maintaining their upward trajectory, a bout of profit taking was overdue. iTraxx Main has tightened by 10bps - from 62bps on the 26th March to 52.5bps yesterday – almost in a straight line. 
"
"Inference. European synthetic credit market added in March 11 new high yield  reference entities to its trading catalog. The new names represent 11 out of the 12 additions to the new series of the European Crossover index. 
  The last one addition is a fallen angel (TDC A/S).  After a month, 
  the roll was march the 20th, the trading of these new names is still rather subdued and a sort 
  of disappointment for market participants. It is hard to assess the true activity. 
  The tip of the Iceberg is the reported cleared volume by LCH CDSCLear, 
  the only CDS clearing house offering to clear these new names. 
    Out of the 11 names, WIND TRE S.P.A. and Verisure Midholding AB are the only one with reported 
	open interests as of yesterday according to OTCStreaming. 
	Some of the new names are well known special situations in the European high yield community. 
	These entities have large bond issues like Picard Bondco S.A. with a 1.2BEuros 5Y FRN 
	issued late last year. But the derivatives community is not familiar with these names
	 especially due to the lack of time series. DataGrapple infers for these entities an 
	 alleged time series using the ""best"" benchmark. The choice of the benchmark is not obvious. 
	 In some situation a benchmark is not relevant. For STEINHOFF EUROPE AG, Datagrapple team decided 
	 to use NEW LOOK SENIOR ISSUER PLC as the best proxy to backward infer a time series (see the attached
 the grapple). DataGrapple provides estimates for all the new CDS entities, hopefully it helps to make some rough estimate  of their risks.
"
"January All Over Again?. Over the last week or so, the price action was reminiscent of what we experienced in January when everybody was focusing on interest rates. Back then, credit unperformed equities. And here we go again, the US 10-year rate is once again flirting with the 3% level and attracting some headlines. It is certainly one of the reasons why US High Yield ETFs had their worst day in more than 12 months on Thursday in terms of outflows. Almost $900mln were pulled out, followed by another $360mln on Friday. It brought the weekly outflow to almost $1.6Bln. This weakness spilled to the synthetic market, and protection has been better bid recently on high yield single reference entity CDS and credit indices alike. Even though it is still rich to its fair value – the risk premium of CDX HY series 29 is tighter than the risk premia of its constituents -, CDX HY series 29 is 70cts cheaper than it was a week ago.
"
"Dispersion. 
It felt like a relatively quiet session overall and the volumes traded on credit indices – you can find them on OTCStreaming - were on the light side. They traded sideways for most of the session before leaking wider into the close when the Nasdaq plunged. At a micro level, it was much more active and there was actually a fair bit of dispersion playing out, particularly in the European Crossover universe with a number of names moving in opposite directions. For instance, UK debt collectors moved tighter after S&P; affirmed IJSS’s ( Intrum Justitia AB ) rating at BB+ and confirmed their stable outlook following their recent strategic partnership with Intesa Sanpaolo to co-manage a significant amount of the Italian bank’s nonperforming loans portfolio. At the same time, LADLN ( Ladbrokes Coral Group Plc) was moving wider after an article in the press suggesting the Treasury is ready to impose a £2 FOBT – Fixed Odd Betting Terminals - limit and offset tax revenue losses with an increased tax on online POC - Point Of Consumption -.
"
"Panic Is Not Setting In. The main event in synthetic credit today was the fact that electronic trading on indices was made difficult on the morning by a system failure. It did not prevent decent volumes to eventually go through though - you can find them on OTC Streaming< /a> -, but the moves were underwhelming. Despite the recent downward pressure on equities, credit indices have been slow to react and did so in a very orderly manner. That is apparent in the options market where implied volatility closed the session slightly lower. Some carry hungry investors are still selling options to collect premium. The other side of the trade is taken by people buying options outright to a certain extent - but with far out of the money (OTM) strikes -, but mainly by people buying payer spread (PS) structures – they buy a first payer with a not too far from the money strike, and sell a second payer with a more out of the money strike -. If some investors are focused on downside protection, they are effectively looking for low conviction ways to protect themselves against further weakness – using PS - or for protection against much larger moves – using OTM options -.
"
"The Week That Was. The price action during the first part of the week was a follow through of what happened the week before. Credit indices widened consistently in a very orderly fashion. It all changed on Thursday, after the ECB press conference. Mr Draghi delivered a balance message and his language provided something for both the hawkish (solid growth, confidence in inflation medium term trajectory) and the dovish (concerns over recent economic performance and growing global protectionism). But what caught investors’ attention was his assertion that discussions about possible monetary policy changes for the June meeting had not started yet. They interpreted it as a suggestion that the ECB is not in a hurry to take another step towards normalisation. That eased the pressure on rates, and encouraged people to take some of their credit hedges off. In the end it was a week for nothing on indices, but there is still a nagging bid for single reference CDS as corporate bonds are feeling the effects of a busy new issue pipeline. Credit indices got richer when compared to their fair values.
"
"The Heat Is On. Once again today was a day where credit index variations were minimal. That was probably to be expected given that part of Europe is off tomorrow and people had already squared their portfolio last week ahead of month end. It did not prevent some big moves of the risk premia of certain corporates though. The biggest of all in Europe was not good news for bondholders of GALAPG (Galapagos Holding S.A.), a member of iTraxx Crossover since series 22. GALAPG is owned by funds managed by Triton, a private equity group. It is the holding company for the operating companies of Galapagos SA, which is a global manufacturer of heat exchangers for industrial applications in sectors ranging from oil and gas to food and beverages. GALAPG released their 4th quarter results this morning, which shown a poor operational performance compared with earlier guidance for that period. But more importantly for credit investors, they also announced they breached some covenants on one of their revolving credit facilities and had to get an equity injection of 22M€ from their sponsor. The company’s 5-year risk premium shot up almost 6 upfront and now stands at 22pts upfront plus 500bps running – that is roughly the equivalent of 1,200bps -. The market estimates that GALAPG has a 65% probability of defaulting over the next 5 years. That is the highest level since its CDS started to trade actively 3 years ago.
"
"A Good Day To Go Shopping. Today was quieter with a good part of Continental Europe closed for Labour day, but yesterday was extremely busy with regards to M&A; transactions. In the US, T-Mobile US Inc agreed to acquire Sprint Corp for $26Bln in stocks, and Marathon Petroleum Corp agreed to buy rival Andeavor for $23.3Bln in the biggest ever deal for an oil refiner that will create the largest independent fuel maker in the US. In Europe SBRY ( J Sainsbury Plc ) said it will purchase UK grocery chain Asda from Walmart Inc’s for about $10Bln, in the form of £3Bln in cash and a 41% stake in the combined business. SBRY currently does not have a rating and its only outstanding debts are two convertible bonds and a £250mln hybrid note. But even after it borrows the money to pay Walmart, analysts expect the new company to be a stronger credit than SBRY in its current form. They are a tad more cautious than the company which expects to have an investment grade going forward though, and reckon that an implicit support from Walmart would be needed to push it solidly into the investment grade category. Investors nevertheless greeted the proposed transaction by sending SBRY’s 5-year risk premium almost 40bps tighter over the last 2 sessions. It closed tonight at 100bps.
"
"Double Whammy. Since November last year, Mr Icahn started to make some noise again as an investor in XRX ( Xerox Corp ) equities. Most recently he has been opposing the terms of XRX’s takeover by Fujifilm announced in January, arguing that they were struck by the CEO of the company without the board’s authorisation merely to preserve his own job. In a surprise statement, XRX said that the CEO and 6 board members agreed to step down. It puts the deal at risk and comes a few days after a New-York judge halted the transaction a few days ago. The tie-up with Fuji has been the driver of XRX’s risk premium tightening from roughly 200bps at the beginning of the year to 100bps. It was no surprise that investors pushed it 30bps wider from the word “go”. That effect was compounded after the European close when an article mentioned that Apollo had approached XRX about a possible deal. Expect the CDS to be another 20bps wider tomorrow. It is trading at 160bps as I type…
"
"A Day Of Two Halves. Despite the stabilisation in US risk overnight, the early focus was on various bearish signs. Emerging markets were under fire as the USD remains strong, and clients and dealers alike got themselves short risk expecting a larger sell-off to follow in the afternoon. Financials – and more specifically banks – were pressured early on by poor results from SOCGEN ( Societe Generale SA ) and BNP ( BNP Paribas SA ). However, after an initial weakness in both credit and equities, we saw a decent turnaround for the affected banks, which saw their 5-year CDS trade off the widest levels. The same was true for the broader market. On the back of an NFP miss, and in the absence of further pressure on EM once the US came in, the usual path ahead of a 3-day week-end prevailed. CDS went from gold to dust, and the market did not even bother to attempt a tick wider at the end of the session.
"
"Ready For Take Off?. Yesterday, the market for European synthetic credit products was closed as investors enjoyed a sunny Early May Bank Holiday. Most equity markets were open though, and shares in AFKLM ( Air France KLM SA ) fell sharply after the sudden resignation of its chief executive over a pay dispute. Mr Lemaire, France’s finance minister, said that “if Air France does not make the necessary competitiveness efforts that will allow this national flagship to be at the same level as Lufthansa or other major global airlines, Air France will disappear.” He added that the government should not be expected to backstop the company. It did not go down well with investors. The strike has already cost the company €300mln and some are even wandering whether KLM could not be tempted to leave the current alliance given the recent upheaval. AFKLM’s stock fell 10% on Monday and its 5-year risk premium played catch up today. It widened 57bps at 262bps. It has now more than doubled since the tights reached at the end of January. 


"
"Astaldi’s Rollercoaster. Once again credit indices have traded in very narrow ranges today. iTraxx Crossover did not move more than a couple of bps away from Tuesday’s close, but some of its constituents commanded some attention, particularly ASTIM ( Astaldi Spa ). The issues of the Italian company, which mainly designs, develops and operates public infrastructure and large scale civil engineering works, begun when they announced last November that they would organise a share sale to bolster their finances after writing down about €230mln because of their exposure to Venezuela. The drama might be about to end. There were reports overnight in the Italian press outlining a plan for an equity raise. A company’s board will be held in a few days and it should approve a €300mln capital increase that would see the participation of IHI Corporation, a Japanese company known for constructing long suspension bridges. The initial reaction was a 19pts tightening of ASTIM’s 5-year risk premium, which was later faded by investors. Nevertheless, ASTIM’s CDS closed the day 11pts tighter, which is a cool 725bps. The cost of insuring €1 of ASTIM’s debt for 5 years is now 26cts upfront plus 5cts per year. That is half what you had to pay barely a month ago.
"
"Back On The radar For All The Wrong Reasons. The last time the credit market really paid attention the sovereigns was a while ago, but this week was all about Emerging Markets and the sovereigns included in the CDXEM. Early on Argentina was under the spotlight after the country had to hike short term interest rates by almost 10 percentage points to stem a currency crisis as the country’s fiscal woes remain unresolved. The government had to bite the bullet and turned to the IMF to demand a $30Bln credit line. The IMF appears to be showing good will to pursue Argentina’s request and that stopped the rot to a certain extent, but investors are waiting for the terms and date of the deal. Argentina’s 5-year risk premium was pushed 72bps wider at 404bps. The Lebanese Republic, Turkey and Egypt all suffered from the renewed tension in the Middle East after America pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal and saw their 5-year risk premia rise 45bps to 570bps, 5bps to 237bps and 10bps to 320bps respectively. Malaysia was also under pressure – its 5-year CDS widened 14bps to 92bps - after the shock defeat in the general election of Prime Minister Najib Razak. It put into question the future of state-owned investment fund 1MDB which has been involved in a money laundering scandal.
"
"From Dull To Duller. Last week was understandably quiet. Almost every single day, some part of Europe was closed because of bank a holiday. There was some hope that today would mark the return of some form of activity, but in the synthetic credit market, trading ranges were tight once again and volumes were equally low – you can find them at OTC Streaming -. If you had told people a few weeks ago that by mid-May Argentina’s risk premium would have doubled and that a coalition of far right and left populist parties would be about to form a government in Italy, I doubt that many would have said that credit would be at the tights of the year and that realised volatility would be rock bottom. It seems that after some bruising experiences over the last couple of years, no one wants to get bear trapped. The result is the uniformly grey above grapple.
"
"Did Options Pin The Market?. The credit market had many reasons today to feel a bit uneasy. The USD showed no sign of weakness. That meant emerging markets were under constant pressure across the board and, combined with the renewed tensions in the Middle East, led to some very bearish price action: the Lebanese Republic’s 5-year risk premium shot up another 50bps and reached 625bps, Turkey’s closed 24bps wider at 261bps. But in all fairness all CDX EM constituents were affected. The US interest rates kept creeping higher, and the 10Y not only traded back up above 3% but also breached the 3.05% level which was deemed to be the next level to watch. And indeed credit indices did drift a tad wider, but the move was really contained – iTraxx Main (ITXEB) widened 1bp and iTraxx Crossover 2bps -. The market felt really reticent to move any further ahead of the option expiry which takes place tomorrow. There is allegedly a big pin – ie a strike with an important option open interest - on the 55bps strike on ITXEB, and effectively sellers of protection were plenty as soon as it traded above that level.
"
"Mamma Mia. A draft of the governing contract between M5S and the League was leaked last night. While it was later dismissed as a previous draft, fully superseded by now, it was dated 14th May and gave a taste of a number of key issues. The least that can be said is that market participants found it disturbing. It included controversial topics such as debt cancellation and a procedure to allow member states to leave the Euro. While apparently deleted in subsequent drafts, the mention of the creation of a mechanism for a potential Italexit gave the sense of a coalition ready to reignite the redenomination risk. On the debt, it was suggested that the ECB should cancel the Italian sovereign bonds it currently holds. The idea is that this debt is neutralised as the interests paid to the Central Bank are reverted to the Italian government, and as such the cancellation would have little impact at least until ECB’s policy of reinvestment holds. This idea – which Charles Ponzi once found quite interesting – suggests that the M5S-Lega coalition would consider the non-repayment of a debt to the ECB. It did not go down that well with markets when Greece floated a similar idea a few years ago… It sent the BTP-Bund spread flying – it closed 21bps wider – and put everything Italian under pressure. Of course, most of the pain in creditland was inflicted to financial institutions, and if you click on the Financial bubble in the above grapple, you will see that the 5-year risk premia of UCGIM (UniCredit SpA) – 7bps wider at 82bps – and ISPIM (Intesa Sanpaolo SpA) – 7.5bps wider at 86bps – were the clear underperformers of the day.
"
"Not A Surprise That They Liked. Usually the direction of the price of oil is a good indicator of where the risk premium of GLENLN (Glencore Plc) is heading to. But today, despite a fairly stable commodity market, the 5-year CDS referencing GLENLN shot up after reports the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is preparing to open a formal bribery investigation into the company and its work with Dan Gertler and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The Israeli businessman and DRC President Joseph Kabila have been implicated in previous British and American bribery investigations. The US imposed sanctions on Gertler as recently as December, saying he has used his friendship with Kabila to corruptly build his fortune. An SFO investigation would add to a growing list of legal challenges for GLENLN and was not priced by the market. There is no certainty to what it could bring, and uncertainty is exactly what investors loathe. GLENLN’s 5-year risk premium traded as wide as 150bps before closing at 138bps, 12bps wider on the day, while its share price lost 4.5%.
"
"It Was All About Italy. Once again, it was all about Italy today. The credit market tried to open unchanged as investors cheered the China/US tariffs headlines published over the week-end, but as soon as the BTP started to sell off against Bund, there was a flurry of protection buyers. Index risk premia started to move wider, but the move never felt panicky and there were healthy two-way flows during the whole session. The widening accelerated in the final hour of trading as the BTP rout took it 21bps wider versus Bund. The relative move between the two govies over the last week is 57bps and the yield differential now stands at 187bps. Over the same period, iTraxx Main (ITXEB) is 5.5bps wider, iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) only 13.5bps wider, iTraxx Financial Senior (ITXES) 11bps wider and iTraxx Financial Subordinated (ITXEU) 24bps wider. The price action was similar today, ITXES and ITXEU underperformed ITXEB, while ITXEX outperformed. The risk premium differential between ITXES and ITXEB now stands at 9bps, which is the largest it has been since the run-up to the French election.
"
"Creative Financing. Over the last few quarters we have seen in the market a few examples of creative financing, where some fund managers have helped companies to get some much-needed cash under terms that enable these investors to book profits on credit derivatives transactions. In Europe, Norske Skogindustrier was an example in 2016, and HOV (Hovnanian Enterprises) was another in the US earlier in the year. It seems that there could be another case with SRAC (Sears). ESL Investment is the biggest shareholder of Sears. Last month it urged the retailer to sell some of it businesses, and tabled a proposal to actually buy some of them. As part of the deal, the fund suggested the company should buy back some its debt which trades at the biggest discount to par. It mechanically decreased the value of the CDS contracts referencing Sears as the cheapest debt could be retired from the market, but also raised the suspicion that ESL could have previously sold protection to benefit from the phenomenon…
"
"Too Busy To Be Bothered. It was probably one the choppiest sessions we have had recently even in the midst of the periphery risk off episode of the last week or so. Financials in particular were pushed back and forth as headlines regarding the progress of the Italian Premier nomination and Turkish interest rates hit the tape. It is probably the reason why some of the focus of the credit market was taken off the possible merger between BACRPLC ( Barclays Plc ) and STANLNPLC ( Standard Chartered Plc ) reported by the press. The rivals would have been exploring a potential merger, as part of a wide-ranging contingency plan being weighted by senior board members following pressure from activist investor Edward Bramson, who emerged as one of BACRPLC’s largest shareholders in March. Even though it was described as one of many ideas kicked by the bank’s management, it was enough to send STANLNPLC’s shares up 3% in the morning. It failed to create any excitement in creditland though. Both names followed the general trend and ended the day wider. STANLNPLC’s 5-year CDS merely underperformed BACRPLC’s by 1.5bps. They closed 4bps wider at 80bps and 2.5bps wider at 96.5bps respectively. 
"
"All Things Considered, No Panic… Yet. The credit market was all about Italy again, and more precisely about the spread between the yield of BTP and Bund. Looking at the market yesterday morning, everything seemed fine: after 5-Star and Lega were not allowed to form a government, BTPs opened some 15bps tighter. But that did not last long, once people realised a technocratic government is not necessary the most likely outcome. Instead snap elections could be held pretty swiftly, and their results is anybody’s guess. We walked in this morning to a 30bps increase in BTP’s yield compared to Bund’s, which very rapidly turned into a +115bps gap. Credit indices duly followed, but if moves were big, considering the carnage on Italian interest rates, one could argue that things were kept under control. Fears for the Euro project are starting to propagate, but the market reaction has been fairly orderly and two way flows have developed quite rapidly, at least on the most liquid instruments, ie credit indices and options on credit indices. Volumes traded today were way above their daily average, as you can see If you go to OTC Streaming.
"
"Spot The Odd One Out. Today the theme in the credit market was clearly about a relief rally. The price action was choppy, but everything Italian had a stellar performance – not if you look at them on a 3-day horizon though! -, particularly financials, and it pushed the whole credit complex tighter. So much attention had been paid recently to the tribulations of Mr Mattarella, that investors almost forget about stories that kept them on their toes a few weeks or a few months ago. They were certainly not expecting to learn that DB’s (Deutsche Bank AG) US business had been added by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to a group of troubled lenders they closely monitor. The decision means they view DB’s federally insured US business as having “financial, operational or managerial weaknesses that threaten its continued financial viability”. DB’s equity tumbled as the news compounds the challenges faced by the German lender, which was told in March by the Fed that it must urgently fix lapses described in a series of settlements over the past few years and lost 7%. 5-year CDS contract referencing its senior debt gapped 35bps to 190bps, while 5-year CDS referencing its subordinated debt touched 400bps (+75bps on the day).
"
"The Week That Was. It was a whipsaw week, dominated by negative headlines across Italy and Spain, leading the credit market in a one-way fashion to the widest levels of the series 29 across all indices. They traded in lockstep with the BTP/Bund spread which blew out to 320bps at some stage on Tuesday. Things calmed down after that episode, and synthetic credits came dramatically off their widest levels. If you spent the week on the moon, you would probably wonder what the fuss was all about. We are finishing off the week tighter in iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) than where we left off last Friday. Equities are firm and cash is feeling strong again. The second part of the week saw a bias towards better selling of protection among the buyside community, with the occasional headline leading credit to gap wider only for it to retest new daily tights. On the week, iTraxx Main (ITXEB) is only 1.5bps wider, iTraxx Financials Senior 3bps wider, iTraxx Financials Subordinated 3bps wider, and ITXEX is 6bps tighter. More than anything else, the main takeaway from the week will be impressive compression between ITXEB and ITXEX.
"
"The Timing Might Not Be Right… Yet. Today marked the third day of recovery in Italian risk. The risk premia of ISPIM ( Intesa Sanpaolo SpA ) and UCGIM ( UniCredit SpA ) actually ended the session through their closing levels of Friday 25th May at 123bps and 116bps respectively. In fact, the latter got an extra kick today as it was reported in the press this morning that a possible merger between the Italian bank and SOCGEN ( Societe Generale SA ) could be under consideration. It is not a bolt from the blue, as a combination of these financial institutions, which ranked among European largests, has been a frequent topic of speculation in the past 10 years. If UCGIM’s CEO Mustier’s past career makes it even more credible, analysts were not entirely convinced. UCGIM is only half way through its 3-year restructuring plan. There are still plenty of unknowns regarding Italy’s new government. The political and regulatory backdrop would be a significant hurdle to come up with an attractive deal. Nevertheless, while UCGIM was the best performer in the financial sector, SOCGEN was one of only a handful of names that did not participate in today’s rally.
"
"Back To Muddy Waters Wides. Since the beginning of the week, strong monthly growth in U.K. consumer spending have helped European retail credit outperform the broader market which have been dragged wider on renewed Italian worries. It did not apply to RALFP ( Rallye SA ) nor COFP ( Casino Guichard Perrachon SA ) though. The risk premia of these two entities went through the roof over the last couple of sessions, after a broker published a note expressing a cautious view on the French retailer’s performance in France and abroad, as well as its complex group structure. Their analysis pointed to significantly negative free cash flow last year, which could impair the ability of COFP to maintain its dividend. As a consequence, RALFP may struggle to refinance its two bonds which come due in October this year, and March next year. RALFP’s 5-year risk premium widened by 8pts upfront in two days. It now stands at 27% + 500bps running (to insure €1 of RALFP’s debt over 5 years, you need to pay 27cts upfront and another 1.25cts every quarter). The market estimates at 70% the probability RALFP will default over the next 5 years, and at 19% the probability it will not make it to next summer…

"China To The Rescue. GNW ( Genworth Financial Inc ) offers insurance, wealth management, investment and financial solutions. It products covers mortgage guaranty, life insurance and long-term care insurance. After it repaid its bonds that came due in May, analysts estimated that the company was left with only $560mln of cash while it faces $1.6Bln of debt maturing in 2020-2021. Since October 2016, GNW has been working on clearing its proposed takeover by China Oceanwide. The transaction was recently revamped to include a $1.5Bln capital contribution that would be used mostly to repay GNW’s debt. News over the week-end that the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States approved the deal after concluding that there are no unresolved security concerns came as a major relief to debt holders. It significantly increases the possibility that GNW’s $2.7Bln sale will go through, which would effectively put the issue of GNW’s bankruptcy that has been on investors’ mind off the agenda. GNW’s 5-year risk premium decreased by 200bps to 425bps, the tightest it has been since mid-2015.

"They Did It Again. As in January 2016 after market concerns about the sustainability of the Rallye/Casino structure which concluded with COFP’s ( Casino Guichard Perrachon SA ) downgrade to non-investment grade, COFP announced yesterday another non-core asset disposal plan to calm the market nervousness of the past few sessions. Last week, its share price dropped by 13% and its 5-year risk premium jumped above 425bps. The company will sell non-core assets – including real estate – worth €1.5Bln to complement the ongoing disposal process of Via Varejo in Brazil. It did not give any details about the breakdown of the assets to be sold, but specified half of the disposals would be completed in 2018, and the other half at the beginning of 2019. The market took the news positively as it confirmed COFP’s deleveraging ambitions, after the surprising cash burn in 2017. The 5-year CDS closed 28bps tighter at 392bps, an impressive performance but meaningfully off the tightest level of the session – it traded down at 360 at some stage -. While some investors were reassured, others are still concerned that “to maintain liquidity, Casino resorts to hollowing out the business through asset sales that destroy the productive value of the company”.

"Waiting for Mario. If credit indices traded sideways over the first two days of the week, the tone certainly improved today. The sentiment in European market was risk-on, comforted by a solid BTP auction which sent the BTP-Bund spread below 230bps this morning. But ahead of the FED and ECB meetings, technical probably played their part as well. The DTTC statistics released today regarding positioning on credit indices showed a large increase of short risk positions during the course of last week. Large amounts of hedges were added across the board, and it looks as if clients felt the need to trim some of these going into the press conference of Mr Draghi. If the ECB delivers a somewhat dovish message and their meeting turns out to be a non-event, then current levels will be vulnerable, especially if Italy goes on the back burner for a while. 
"
"Goodbye CSPP. After the Fed on Wednesday, markets were focused on the ECB decision and announcement on rates and QE taper this week. Rather than being put off by the round of tariffs on Chinese goods confirmed by the US or by the renewed tensions among European countries on the back of the Aquarius saga, investors focused on the creatively dovish elements introduced by the ECB in their statement on Thursday. “The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remains aligned with the current expectations of a sustained adjustment path”. The big shock was that inclusion of calendar based guidance on rates which is the first time the ECB has done such a thing and is a material evolution to the policy framework. What happens if inflation edges up unexpectedly over the next 12-15 months is anybody’s guess. The other dovish element was the taper reference. Unsurprisingly, the ECB announce a cut to €15bn/month from September (with QE ending in December) but the caveat was that it would still be “subject to incoming data confirming the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation outlook”. It certainly looks like conditional taper. Volatility addicts might go through another painful patch, and last week’s wides now look a distant memory.

"Series 29 Is Not The Only One. A new week started with a new round of things to worry. iTraxx Main (ITXEB) and iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) were pushed 2bps wider at 68bps and 4bps wider at 299bps at the close respectively, even though they finished the day slightly off their widest levels. In Europe, investors are worried about a potential breakdown within Mrs Merkel’s coalition with the CSU around immigration policies. She bought some time after she accepted a 2-week deadline which allows her to kick the can down the road a bit. Nevertheless, the remote possibility of this kicking off reintroduced an element of “European tail” in the equation. Also, everybody is waiting for the next blow in the US-China trade war. Options probably played their part in keeping the market in check, as the next expiry is due on Wednesday. Not because of any major pin in sight on ITXEB or ITXEX series 29, but rather because of positions on ITXEB series 28 with a 60 strike which triggered some rehedging as soon as this level was broken.

"Rolling Black Outs. Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd generates, transmits and distributes electricity to industrial, mining, commercial, agricultural and residential customers, and to municipalities throughout South Africa. The utility, which controls almost all the country’s electricity, has been entangled in a dispute over pay with its workers for some time and power generation has been disrupted since industrial action started on June 13. The disruption is in part the result of road closures which have prevented coal deliveries to storage facilities. Amid allegations of intimidation and sabotage at some power stations, Eskom had to introduce rolling black outs, as the dispute coincides with rising consumption during South Africa’s winter. Today, the company eventually tabled a deal offering a 4.7% increase and a four-year agreement linked to inflation in order to resolve the conflict. But, according to the company, bringing full stability back to the grid will only be achieved with the return of employees and a return to normal will take about 10 days. Since the beginning of the stand-off, investors have pushed Eskom’s 5-year risk premium 100bps wider at 513bps.

"R.I.P. iTraxx Main Series 9. Today was option expiry day. June is traditionally a busy one as this maturity – with March, September and December – is one that is actively quoted throughout the preceding 7 or 8 months. If this one felt really quiet, it was enough to pin the market on the 4 most liquid benchmarks. iTraxx Main (ITXEB), iTraxx Crossover, CDX IG and CDX HY spent the session wrapped around 67.5bps, 300bps, 62.5bps and 106.75 (or 339bps) respectively, which are all option strikes. That said, there was not too much delta overflow post 4pm - which is the actual deadline to exercise a credit index option on expiry day – which means options’ rehedging might not have been the only factor. Between the risk caused by a trade war and an hawkish Fed on one hand, and a very dovish Draghi and a decent confidence in credit evidenced by the 22Bln order book for the 5Bln deal announced by Bayer on the other hand, the market may just be finely poised. That subdued activity – you can see the volumes traded if you visit OTC Streaming - was the opportunity for those who have been in the CDS market for a few years to spare a thought for iTraxx Main Series 9, which saw its last remaining maturity mature today. Arbitragers now fighting to capture a few cents will remember fondly the 3.8% discount at which this index was trading compared to its fair value at the height of the Great Financial Crisis.

"Headwind For The European Automotive Sector. Until very recently, many thought that trade war issues would fade away. But over the last few days, the first measures and countermeasures effectively kicked in, and some could prove extremely disruptive to car-makers for their production set-up and for their profit margins. BMW and Mercedes have both made the US their global SUV manufacturing hub, and they will be among the main casualties of the tariffs imposed by China on American exports. So much so that it prompted DAIGR’s ( Daimler AG ) warning this week that its 2018 profit will drop because of fewer Mercedes-Benz SUV exports from its Alabama factory. It was one of the first big industrial businesses in Europe to cite and quantify the most recent escalation in trade rhetoric as a headwind in its trading update. If President Trump goes ahead with the 20% tariff he threatened to impose on all European car imports this afternoon, the recent underperformance of Autos’ risk premia in Europe could have more legs.
"
"New Issues Are Flying Off The Shelves. We kicked off the week with iTraxx Crossover 9bps wider closing at 315bps. President Trump’s trade rhetoric and the reactions it provokes around the globe are weighting on risky assets, and the tone was certainly risk off today. Nevertheless, new issues keep coming, and they keep trading well, but for a reason: companies are offering substantial discounts compared with existing bonds. The latest example was SKGID ( Smurfit Kappa ), the corrugated packaging company. They said this morning that they would raise €500mln via the issue of euro denominated senior notes due in 2026, and bearing a coupon of 2.75% to 3% to finance the acquisition of Reparenco Holding that they previously announced. While the deal was upsized to €600mln, the coupon was eventually set at 2.875%, which repriced existing SKGID’s bonds. Their bond due in 2025 bearing a 2.75% coupon was marked 1.5pts lower, and their 5-year risk premium jumped 17bps to 111bps.
"
"Mixed Feelings. It was a bizarre session in credit land. At the close, everybody had the feeling that it had been a weak day. Indeed, as the morning developed, a reasonably strong open turned into a broad-based widening of risk premia. Peripheral financials were put under severe pressure when Emerging Markets turned weak and some supply of Italian and Spanish government bonds hit the market. Around lunchtime, periphery was 20bps in subordinated and 5 to 10bps wider in senior. Credit indices were pushed towards their recent wides, iTraxx Main touched 75bps and iTraxx Crossover 320bps. Once it appeared that the government debt sales would be absorbed and would not derail the market, the widening ran out of steam and profit takers emerged on indices. They spent the afternoon trending back to unchanged or even tighter levels across the board, while the risk premia of single corporate were a tad stickier around their widest levels. These contrasting price actions pushed bases tighter on all credit indices. 
"
"Mexico Is Looking Left. Over the week-end, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was the first left-wing president to be elected in Mexico in decades. He was brought to power by a public revolt against rampant crime, corruption and misery. He defeated the candidates of the business-friendly parties. While he said he would “give preference to the poorest and to the forgotten” during his acceptance speech, he also made a point of allaying market concerns. He promised to respect the central bank autonomy, to avoid raising taxes in real terms, and to stay within legal channels as he reviews oil deals approved under the outgoing president. He also promised not to nationalise companies nor quit Nafta. He said his program of social reforms can be funded without increasing the country’s deficit, with the money saved by eliminating graft. Economists are sceptical and investors do not want the new government to become another left-populist regime similar to the ones that ran Venezuela or Brazil into the ground. There was no massive rush for the exit, but Mexico’s 5-year risk premium was nevertheless marked 10bps wider at 140bps.
"
"Glencore Remains In The Penalty Box. This morning GLENLN (Glencore Plc) announced that it received a subpoena from the US Department of Justice yesterday regarding potential money-laundering allegations. US authorities have requested that the Swiss miner produce documents with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and related to the group’s business in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Venezuela from 2007 to date. When charged by US authorities, companies generally agree to settle the charges by paying an amount close to the estimated profits resulting from the bribes (disgorgement), and a criminal penalty close to the disgorgement amount. Even if circumstances and facts are different in this case, one of the largest DoJ fines for Money Laundering came in 2012 for HSBC and was worth $1.9bn. At the close of business today, investors had sent GLENLN’s stock 8% down, wiping out $5.4Bln of the company’s market capitalisation. They also pushed its 5-year risk premium 24bps wider at 208bps. One could argue that until we get further details, most of the damage is probably done, but with more and more people focusing on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors as considerations in their investment analysis, one should expect more volatility over the next few days.
"
"Only The Tip Of The Iceberg?. Until 3 years ago, DANBNK ( Danske Bank A/S ) offered banking services at its Estonian branch to residents of other countries. Those operations have now embroiled the Copenhagen-based lender in the Nordic region’s biggest money laundering scandal. Many of these non-resident clients were from so-called high-risk countries, with weak defences against money laundering, including Russia, Moldova and Azerbaijan. Danske had indications of possible wrong-doing but only began terminating business with non-resident account holders after it got a report in 2013 by a whistle blower. Since May, when DANBNK was reprimanded by its regulator in Copenhagen and ordered to hold an additional 5Bln kroner in regulatory capital -, 5-year CDS referencing the bank’s senior debt moved from 30 to 45bps. It emerged today that customers would have used the Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015 to launder 53Bln Kroner – roughly $8.3Bln -, more than double previous estimates. DANBNK’s CDS was pushed another 7bps wider to 51bps, making it one of the worst performers among financials in an otherwise rather positive session.

"When Zero Is Better Than Twenty. The US ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, met German carmakers yesterday, with the message that he had been mandated by the White House to help find a solution on tariffs with the EU. German companies advocate the cancellation of tariffs on passenger vehicles between the EU and the US. Currently, a vehicle exported to the US is taxed at 2.5% to 4%, while a vehicle imported from the US is taxed at 10%. The US is fighting for more balanced duties. However, a commonly held opinion is that European consumers do not buy US vehicles because they do not fit their requirements (size, fuel consumption, poor fit to European driving conditions), not because of high duties. Mr Trump threatened last month to impose a 20-percent import tariff on all EU-assembled vehicles. It certainly had the potential to upend the industry’s current business model for selling cars in the United States, and it had weighted on car manufacturers’ risk premia. An end to the tariffs between US and Europe could put an end to the dispute, with no loser. Investors breathed a sigh of relief and made autos the best performing group today.
"
"Wishful Thinking?. DB (Deutsche Bank AG) has been in the news recently for all the wrong reasons, and it has driven its share price to record low levels last month. A management reshuffle and a plan to reduce its global presence have failed to revive investors’ confidence. There was probably an element of wishful thinking when the market initially took at face value rumours that ICBC (Industrial and Commercial Bank of China) and JP Morgan were interested in an investment in DB, because the importance of Frankfurt will grow after Brexit. It propelled DB’s stock almost 7% higher and its 5-year risk premium traded down to 135bps. This 30bps tightening did not last long though. If ICBC and DB declined to comment, JPM swiftly rejected the speculation, saying “we are denying the story, it is not true”. 5-year CDS refencing DB's debt managed to hold some of their gain, but the 151bps close was not enough to interrupt the widening trend initiated early February.
"
"Brexit Is Back. If the credit market appeared to have put Brexit on the back burner for a while, it was back with a bang today. In the morning, the market took the departure of Brexit secretary David Davis in its stride, and even interpreted it as a sign hard Tory Brexiteers are now a minority unable to influence policy. But the mood changed when Boris Johnson, who was the face of the campaign to exit the European Union, also resigned over disagreement about Theresa May’s strategy for leaving the bloc. On Friday, the Prime Minister announced that she had secured the backing of her whole Cabinet for her Brexit proposal, and told ministers to back it or resign. But instead of benefitting from a rare show of unity, she will have once more to battle to stave off a full-blown crisis. Today’s resignations added to market fears of a leadership challenge and further UK political paralysis. As a consequence, the risk premia of UK banks were pushed wider (RBS +6bps @ 113bps; Barclays + 5.5bps @ 114.5bps; Lloyds +4.5bps @ 99bps) and underperformed other financials which benefitted from an otherwise fairly positive tone.

"Would Cuneyt Cakir do a better job as a central banker?. Turkey CDS was little changed today after widening 30bps yesterday and 26bps the day before. The CDS is now anchored above 300bps. It is one of the most traded CDS, with close to 500MUSD daily reported cleared notional according to OTC Streaming. This is as Erdogan extended his grip over the Turkish economy, on both the monetary side and the fiscal side. On the monetary side, Erdogan claims the exclusive power to name Central Bank (CBRT) rate setters, and on the fiscal side, he named his son-in-law as economic chief (‘Treasurer and Finance Minister’). Historically, he has always tried to push CBRT to keep rates low to help growth (c7.5% y in Q1), regardless of soaring inflation (c15.5% y in June). As a ripple effect, BBVA underperformed among European financials, due to its exposure to Turkey (c12% net attributable Q1 profit / BBVA largest shareholder of Garanti with a c50% stake). Turkey remains on the top of the EM vulnerability list, with its large current account deficit ($5.9bn vs $5.3b expected in June), uncontrolled inflation and Erdogan in the driving seat. Yesterday we have seen a Turkish referee on the football field, but the country seems to lack a referee to moderate Erdogan’s nepotism. Even imperfect, a Turkish football referee would sound more moderate , as an alternative.

"Good News or Bad News: Which Do You Want First?. Today Xerox was said to consider the sale of its leasing unit, which sounds like a positive news for 
credit investors out of context, because it could relieve the firm of about $3.6b in debt. However, 
in this particular case, the potential sale would be done in order to make Xerox more attractive to 
potential acquirers and would enable PEs to lever up the company more afterwards. On the back of
 that report published by Reuters, Xerox’s 5Y CDS came c20bp so far in this session. A high likelihood
  of an LBO is negative for credit, going forward. XRX is an old member of the CDX IG index, being a 
  component since the series s11. The name has a $1.3b cleared open interest, according to 
  OTC Streaming. 
  Meanwhile the global CDS indices tightened on short capitulation/gamma selling, ahead of next Wednesday's 
  credit index option July expiry.

"When Low Is Low Enough. The reporting season is only beginning, and this used to be the time of the year when Alcoa was systematically mentioned as it used to be the first corporate to announce its results. Part of the company, which produces and distributes aerospace products, split from Alcoa Corporation, which produces and sells bauxite, alumina and aluminium products, and is now known as ARNC ( Arconic Inc ). It will report in a couple of weeks. Nevertheless, it attracted most of the headlines in the US credit market today. As of Friday, its stock was down 44% from the high it reached mid-January. It had suffered from tensions concerning the US aluminium and steel tariffs that have roiled metal producers. It is in this context that the Wall Street Journal reported late on Friday that private equity firms would be circling the company. Even though it is facing operational challenges, its weak cash generation and attractive valuation offer potential buyers a favourable entry point according to analysts. LBOs are synonymous of increased leverage, and while they sent ARNC’s stock 10% higher, investors pushed the company’s 5-year risk premium 85bps wider at 283bps.

"One Up, One Down. It was a fairly busy day in terms of idiosyncratic news, particularly in Europe, but the TMT sector was front and centre. TLSNSS ( TeliaSnoera AB ) has announced that it will buy TDCDC’s ( TDC A/S ) Norwegian activities for NOK21Bln. The company will not tap the bond market even though the dividend policy, the share buy-back plan, and the potential acquisition of Bonnier Broadcasting are unaffected. The transaction will be financed fully with cash-at-hand and is expected to push the net debt/EBITDA ratio to 1.9x. As far as TDCDC’s investors are concerned, the sale is nothing unexpected. It probably happened earlier than they expected though. It is largely assumed that the proceeds will be used to repay debt as the company manages its debt pile and rating, and some bonds should be redeemed. The news put a bit of pressure on TLSNSS’s 5-year risk premium which was the only name wider (+3bps at 45bps) in an otherwise positive session for risk. It also sent TDCDC’s 5-year CDS 19bps wider at 220bps, making it by far the best performer of the sector.
"
"The Trend Is Wider. Banks enjoyed a fairly positive start to the week. On Monday, DB (Deutsche Bank AG) surprised the market with an unusual positive profit warning, ahead of the publication of its results next week. Yesterday, RBSGRP (Royal Bank Of Scotland Group Plc) outperformed the broader market after it was upgraded by Moody’s from Baa3 to Baa2. The rating agency explained that “credit risk (had) decreased materially over the past five years, driven by reductions in non-core assets and non-performing loans”. But some shine was taken off the initial 10bps tightening as profit takers emerged and drove the 5-year risk premium back 101bps, only 4bps tighter on the day. That trend was intact during today’s session, and RBSGRP’s 5-year CDS closed at 104bps, back to pre-upgrade levels. It looks as if investors currently struggle to look past the uphill battle Theresa May is fighting to retain her leadership. Yesterday, her government narrowly defeated an amendment initiated by pro-Europe members of the Tory party to her proposed custom bill, after it had to cope with the defections of prominent Brexiteers in the past few weeks. The trend of RBSGRP’s 5-year CDS is resolutely wider since the beginning of February, and it remains intact at the moment.

"99 Francs: Advertisers in free fall.. Publicis' (PUBFP) sales unexpectedly fell in Q2 (-2.1% vs +1.1% consensus). That resulted in a wider CDS spread (+7bp on the 5y) and a slumping share price (-9%). Earlier this week, a similar story happened to Omnicom (OMC) across the Atlantic, which raises concerns about the advertising sector as a whole. Three factors seem to explain those underwhelming results: 1/ new European data-protection regulations ('GDPR') 2/ growing competition from tech (Google) and consulting firms (Accenture) 3/ a volatile healthcare business in the US. Those 3 factors are common features to the whole sector and it is not surprising to see WPPLN widening in sympathy with PUBFP today. That being said, the advertising industry is currently reinventing itself with the digital. Today the digital represents less than a tenth of PUBFP revenue, but the pace at which this segment is growing is strong (up c25% this quarter). Elsewhere, it was a widening session in Europe (Main+2 XO +5 Sen +5 Sub +11), UK financials leading the way as people reassessed the UK political risk.

"Every Ship Needs A Captain. Sergio Marchionne engineered both the turnarounds of Italian carmaker Fiat which he took over in 2004, and Chrysler, which Fiat acquired in 2009 in a deal with the US government, creating FCAIM ( Fiat Chrysler Automobiles ), the world’s seventh-largest carmaker, out of two formerly dysfunctional entities. He steadied the ship, and even announced last month in his most recent presentation to analysts that the quarterly results would show zero debt at FCAIM for the first time. Investors learnt on Saturday, that Mr Marchionne will not lead the next earning presentation on Wednesday and that he actually had to leave the company with immediate effect due to ill health. The board of the company named Jeep executive Mike Manley as CEO, which in turn triggered the resignation of FCAIM’s European chief, Alfredo Altivila. His exit deprives the company of crucial management experience at a time when it will be needed most following the sudden retirement of Mr Marchionne, in an industry that could be heavily impacted if the current US trade war rhetoric were to materialise. That bout of uncertainty led investors to mark FCAIM’s 5-year risk premium 8bps wider to 180bps.
"
"Are Investors Getting Unsettled?. Over the last couple of weeks, investors had plenty to digest with the beginning of the reporting season and they spent most of their time scrutinising companys’ results. Nevertheless, macroeconomic considerations are still present in the background and the recent tensions on Italy’s 10-year interest rates have not gone unnoticed. Mr Salvini’s remarks that he would prefer to keep within EU budget restrictions, but that “if (Italy had) to go above those limits for the good of the Italians, that (would) not be a problem for (him)” revived investors’ concerns. It puts him at odds with Finance minister Giovanni Tria, who said the Italian government will implement its program within the EU limits so as not to trigger higher borrowing costs, damage growth and worsen the country’s debt burden. Investors have so far banked on Mr Tria to bring a degree of moderation to Italy’s populist government, but it is the second scare they had in a week after it was rumoured in the press that he might be pushed out in a power struggle over who should lead the state development bank. That environment is not helping, and as you can see in the above grapple, the risk premia of financial institutions has started to drift wider and have underperformed their peers during the last 5 trading sessions.

"1,000,000%. The last few weeks have proved quite volatile as far as Turkey’s 5-year risk premium was concerned, especially since Mr Erdogan claimed the exclusive right to name Central Bank (CBRT) rate setters. His grip over monetary policy was obvious in yesterday’s unexpected decision by the CBRT to leave rates unchanged. It prompted a 3% loss of the lira against the US dollar, and pushed Turkey’s risk premium 22bps wider to 315bps, near its recent wides. Mr Erdogan wants to limit rate hikes in order to avoid hurting growth, regardless of inflation. The next report on that front is due towards the end of next week. It will follow a 15.4% (YoY) print released for the month of June, but it will certainly pale in comparison with the shocking number announced yesterday by the IMF regarding Venezuela. They expect inflation to hit 1,000,000% by the end of the year in the Bolivarian Republic, a situation only comparable to Germany in the 1920s. That is almost 4% per day…

"Banking on Banks, not Central Banks. Today we count multiple lenders among the Main’s best performers. That is mainly on the back of Markit's announcement regarding the future roll. For the upcoming Itraxx Europe Series s30, Danish and Spanish senior non-preferred reference obligations will be selected if available. Consequently, DANBNK is tighter -5.5bp, BBVA/SANTAN -6bp. Additionally, if Italian banks issue more Tier 3 paper (T3), their T3 could be included in the Mar19 roll (s30-s31). That helped BACRED to tighten -8bp, ISPIM -8.5bp, UCGIM -7bp. The Senior Financial index outperformed the Main even though the 10y BTP/DBR spread is +2bp wider on the day. Elsewhere it was a decently risk-on session which saw CDS and indices tighten, after the constructive Trump-Juncker meeting and what was probably the least eventful ECB meeting I can remember of. Next week the FOMC meeting may well be ""as intense"", while, for once, the focus may be more on the BOJ.


"
"Short-Term Gain, Long-Term Pain?. Today we had all the ingredients to see BBVA 5y CDS wider:
•	We had BTPs widening vs Bunds (+4bp in 10s), after the local press suggested that Grillo was relaunching a Euro-exit movement in Italy, and ahead of Monday's supply (5s and 10s). 
•	We had most peripheral banks' CDS wider on the back of that (IT banks +3/4bp SANTAN +2bp).
•	We had TURKEY wider (+4bp), still close to the post-GFC widest level (315bp vs 340bp). For reference, BBVA is the biggest shareholder in Turkiye Garanti Bankasi (c50% stake).

But BBVA 5y CDS actually closed tighter, after its Q2 earnings came at the very top of the expectation spectrum (net €1.3B). The beat was driven by higher NII/fees and lower LLPs. Despite today’s outperformance, the Turkish risk is still looming. In Q2, the Turkish unit’s NPL ratio is up 3.2% QoQA and its CoR is up c1% QoQA. Depending on future developments in Erdogan’s Turkey, that trend may well worsen the picture for Spain's #2 bank.
"
"It Had To Give. Throughout most of last week, there was a significant disconnection between the price action on credit indices and the price action of CDS referencing single name entities. It was most obvious on iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) moved in a straight line from a wide of 295bps on Monday to 277bps at the close on Thursday, while during the same interval its theoretical value (computed using the individual risk premia of its constituents) hardly moved. As a result, the basis of ITXEX series 28 (the difference between the quoted value of the index and its theoretical value) went to its most negative value over the last 12 months and reached almost 1%. It triggered multiple arbitrage attempts where people were looking to buy ITXEX protection and sell protection on its constituents. A number of these succeeded. They left dealers owning single name CDS that they have not been able to recycle right away. It was no surprise that, since Friday, while index protection traded wider, single name protection traded sideways and even closed tighter today, as everybody is trying to move to the next trade.
"
"A Bumpy Road Ahead?. The reporting season is drawing to an end, but it is still keeping investors busy at the moment. Today TTMTIN (Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc) released their numbers for the first quarter of the 2018-19 fiscal year, and they did not reassure the market. Since late 2015, TTMTN has benefitted from a growing average selling price for its cars which was able to offset volume declines. But this growth has stalled, evidencing the fact that fierce competition within the SUV segment is feeding through to TTMTIN’s competitive position. The increased pricing pressure is coming at a time when commodity inflation is rising, which will further limit profitability. Furthermore, the company is spending to expand its vehicle portfolio, including the electric Jaguar I-Pace which is designed to compete with Tesla’s Model X, which will come at the expense of weaker credit metrics in the near term. Finally, TTMTIN’s recent decision to increase its dividend towards a 25% pay-out to parent Tata Motors, about a 50% increase from past practises, is adding another headwind to its credit profile. These factors, combined with the potential impact of Brexit, led investors to reassess TTMTN’s 5-year risk premium, and they sent it 26bps wider at 336bps.

"Like The World Cup, Summer Won’t Last Forever. NXTLN ( Next Plc ) announced this morning that second quarter own-brand sales rose 2.8% in the 12 weeks to July 28. Although it was a tad below analysts’ consensus, it was above the company’s own estimates. But what really caught investors’ attention was the company’s analysis of the situation. They explained that this bump was a result of the recent heatwave which prompted customers to buy more T-shirts, shorts and linen dresses. Importantly, they said that the purchases made in July would take demand away from August. Accordingly, they left their forecast for full year profit unchanged. Investors took it as a warning of what is to come for other clothing retailers. It was also a reminder that Britons’ free spending over the summer on everything from clothing to trips to the pub to watch the World Cup will have to end. Knowing that sentiment will not be helped by the political turmoil of Brexit either, they adopted a cautious stance on the British retailers which were the worst performing group in creditland today.

"Macro vs Micro. This week sees Q2 results from more than half of SnrFin index members, and those have been pretty solid so far. Indeed, the clear majority of banks/insurers have delivered higher-than-expected earnings, along with sustained strong capital/asset quality ratios. In this context, one can legitimately wonder why SnrFin is wider and why SX7E is down, this week. The answer isn’t in Q2 reports, though. The sentiment now is risk-off, I think for good reason. Higher US tariffs on Chinese goods look increasingly likely, with Trump considering hiking levies on $200B of imports from 10% to 25%. Consistently with their previous rhetoric, Chinese officials have pledged to retaliate. The puzzling thing is that one of the reasons mentioned by the WSJ to justify additional tariffs is the fast depreciating yuan. Indeed, $CNH is up 10% since March, mainly on the back of... trade tensions! Under the big assumption that Trump’s reaction function remains consistent, we will certainly see some escalation in trade tariffs by the end of the year, most probably hurting risky assets further.

"Chi Va Piano Va Sano (Slowly but Surely). This week, Italy CDS has been widening slowly (if compared to the May/Jun move) but surely, on fears of frictions between Tria, Salvini and Di Maio about the 2019 budget. The 10y BTP has broken above 3%, reaching 268bp vs Bund. Cash trading was thin and low liquidity has certainly been a factor exacerbating the moves. But the widening is not less meaningful, and it suggests that August 2018 will not be a classical August for carry trades in peripheral EGBs. Last night, SocGen rates strategists went out of their long BTPs, rotating into OATs. Not the same yield (just 33bp over Bund in 10s vs 252bp for BTPs), not the same risk either... Despite summer break beginning for Italian MPs next week, the timeline is going to be pretty tight with credit rating reviews starting in just two weeks, with Fitch on Aug 17. Moody's will follow on Sep 7, and S&P; on Oct 26. The draft budget will then have to be delivered to the EC by Oct 15, which will assess it by Nov 30. On this bumpy road, the headline risk remains elevated for Italian assets. Beyond Italian borders, Italy's underperformance is behind SnrFin underperformance vs Main and Main underperformance vs CDX IG.
"
"It Pays To Get Good Grades. CMZBSUB (-16) was the best performer in the iTraxx SubFin index today, after the #2 German bank was upgraded to A1 and its T2s were upgraded to Baa3 by Moody’s. Now T2s are IG-rated by all the three main agencies. Cash subordinated bonds climbed to the highest in 18M+ and the stock was in green territory despite SX7E being -0.3% lower. This year, CMZB (+26 YTD) has been among outperformers in iTraxx SnrFin index (+35 YTD), notably tighter vs its rival DB (+70 YTD). That trend may well continue, as DB was downgraded to Baa3 in the same time. Elsewhere, HSBC results had little impact on credit, and the Italian complex stabilized in line with the BTP/Bund spread. 
"
"Hertz’s Beat: Keep Fading?. Despite growing competition and sluggish demand in the car rental industry, Hertz (HTZ) reported better-than-expected Q2 results (revenue was $2.39B vs $2.31B). On the back of that, the CDS is tighter -108bp and the stock is up 24%, as I write. That said, Net Debt/EBITDA is still high (10x) and the company is still losing money (although less than expected). It is one of the biggest shorts (Short Interest 25% of Free Float), and most analysts agree that the bearish sentiment is likely to stay, in part due to the ride-sharing-induced lack of pricing power in the industry. HTZ’s peer Avis Budget (CAR) is tighter -28bp in sympathy, ahead of its own release, post US close tonight. Elsewhere it was a risk-on session which saw CDS indices tighten across the board, taking most on-the-run skews down, except on CDX HY and iTraxx Australia.
"
"Cold War Headlines Unfreeze Russia CDS . Russian markets were under pressure today, on speculation that the US may tighten its sanctions towards Russia on election meddling. Russian media published today the full text of a sanctions bill prepared by some US senators, last week. The two main measures are a ban for purchasing new OFZ issues and the suspension of USD accounts for Russian state banks. Beyond this, that confirms that many Republicans disapprove Trump’s soft approach towards Russia. 5y CDS is wider +9bp today, $RUB is up c2.5% and OFZs are wider 20-25bp in the belly of the curve (2-5y). The US House is back from summer recess in September, so no action should be taken by then, which does not mean the market can’t price in more Russian risk premium in the meantime.
"
"Not Big Enough To Not Fail?. Rite Aid (RAD) CDS is wider by c6pp this week, now at the YTD wide, just below 1,000bp. This week, the company lowered its earning guidance (on Aug 6) and the shareholders rejected a merger with ABS (on Aug 8), after ABS refused to raise their bid. Leverage (Tot Debt/EBITDA) now looks settled north 5x in the near future, since RAD has cut its F19 EBITDA guidance from $615-675M to $540-590M. The next bond maturity is not too close (Apr 23s), but the outlook for RAD does not look bright either. Mainly because RAD is subscale (compared to its peers CVS Health and WBA) in a competitive retail pharmacy industry where scale is crucial from a CoGS standpoint. The sale of 1,932 stores to WBA was good news in the short term, as it improved RAD’s stability, but longer term that makes RAD less competitive. Now that the merger with ABS is also off the table, years ahead look challenging for profitability.
"
"Roasted. Turkey was under pressure today again, with the 5y CDS wider c70bp and $TRY up c16%. The YTD moves are quite impressive: c270bp on the 5y CDS and  c70% on $TRY. Today’s selloff was amplified by low liquidity and occurred in three steps, before reverting partly towards the end of the session. Firstly, overnight, the FT reported that the ECB was concerned over some Eurozone banks exposed to Turkey (namely UniCredit, BBVA and BNP), given the recent plunge in the lira. Secondly, Erdogan gave a hawkish speech, calling people to convert USD/XAU back into TRY. Thirdly, Trump authorized steel & aluminium tariffs to be doubled for Turkey. Beyond Turkey, this sparked a risk-off sentiment throughout the session and across markets. EM was logically hit the hardest (CDXEM +16), but European risky assets also repriced (Main +3.8 XO +10 SX5E -2%), with financials underperforming (SnrFin +6.2 SX7E -3.2%). The US market was surprisingly resilient, before leaning more risk-off (SPX -0.8% CDX IG +2.8) after the European close.
"
"Another Day Another Record. Turkey was under pressure today again, the 5y CDS was bid above 600bp at some point, slightly after noon in London. There was $756M reported cleared notional according to OTCStreaming. Today’s move takes the YTD to +420bp on the 5y and +84% on $TRY. Over the weekend, the Turkish Finance Minister Albayrak reiterated that he was against capital controls. Erdogan had made it clear earlier that he is against rate hikes. Their strategy is to desperately try to prevent/punish TRY shorts, rather than pushing through tangible measures to bring back investor confidence. Today’s sell-off was different from Friday’s in the sense that it looked more idiosyncratic than systemic. Among CDX EM constituents, we have had two distinct buckets: the ‘high-yielders’ (TURKEY +130 ARGENT +60 LEBAN +33) and the others (-5/+10). Elsewhere, risky assets were down but to a lesser extent than on Friday (Main +1.5 IG +1 SPX -0.1% SX5E -0.5%).
"
"Similar Moves, Different Stories. Argentina and Turkey have been the two sovereign CDS under the limelight, over the past few sessions. Yesterday wider (AR +60 TR +70), today tighter (AR -60 TR -80), Argentina and Turkey have features in common: current account and budget deficits, fast inflation, non-autonomous central banks, vulnerability to $ strength. But on the monetary side of the equation, the BCRA has taken ample measures to stem the crisis, contrary to the CBRT. Yesterday, the BCRA has hiked the 7D Leliq rate from 40% to 45% (adding that it will keep it there, at least until OCT) and sold c$500M in the FX market to keep ARS sub 30 per dollar. To stem ARS volatility, the BCRA also said that it will phase out c$33B ST notes by DEC and will make $ auctions harder to anticipate. Oppositely, in Turkey, Erdogan’s control over the CBRT has become absolute since the June vote. As part of his willingness to islamise the Turkish society, Erdogan said many times he is against hikes (‘evil’) by the CBRT. However, it is difficult to see how Turkey can attract investments with real rates close to zero, potentially leaning towards negative if inflation soars (especially after the recent rapid TRY depreciation).
"
"Sometimes, a Beat Is Not Enough. Macy’s (FD) raised its full-year EPS guidance (mid-point $4.05 from $3.85) and beat the analysts’ consensus on top line ($5.57B vs $5.55B est). However, the stock is trading down 14% and the 5y CDS is wider +13bp (worst performer in the CDX IG index, so far today). The beat was mainly driven by asset sales, credit revenue and taxes. But as far as its core business is concerned, Macy's is still struggling to increase sales as foot traffic dwindles at malls. Retailers must now compete with Amazon's powerful e-commerce platform. And that is in the context of strong consumer spending, helped by the tax reform and the strong employment growth. Elsewhere spreads widened (Main +2.5 CDXIG +1.5) led by the decline in stocks (SX5E -1.5% SPX -1.2%). Tech and commodity sectors were particularly under pressure, following Tencent’s bad results and oil/metals dips respectively. CDX IG (finally) broke above 63, with decent volumes exchanged (>$11B as I write, according to OTCStreaming).
"
"No Concession. Atlantia (ATLIM) was under pressure from the open, in the aftermath of Morandi bridge’s collapse. For reference, the Morandi bridge was operated and maintained by Atlantia’s 88%-owned OpCo Autostrade. Headwinds are multiple, going forward: restoration costs, safety upgrades (local press reported wide safety assessments on the network), litigation costs, and, importantly, the potential licence revocation. Since the bridge’s collapse, the 5y CDS is wider by c170bp, and the stock price has fallen by c27%, meaning that c€5.5B have been shaved off ATLIM’s market value. Given the limited information we have so far, an imminent downgrade seems less likely than a change of outlook, but it remains a real risk in the medium term. ATLIM is currently rated BBB/Baa2/BBB+, just few notches above junk... Additionally, key personnel changes could weigh on investor confidence, by bringing strategic uncertainty. ATLIM CDS trading was pretty active (c11% of Open Interest cleared at ICE Europe, according to OTCStreaming) and its widening largely contributed to Main underperformance (1bp+) in London AM. Elsewhere, credit was generally stronger, as news broke overnight that China would send its Vice Commerce Minister to the US for trade talks as soon as next week, according to the WSJ.

"Never Give Up. J.C. Penneys published yesterday a weak set of earnings. The company forecasts to lose money this year. The market capitalization of the company is now half a billion USD with more than 4 billion debts. They are going down the rating grid, Moody’s downgraded the company to B3 from B2 today. The name is actively traded in the CDS market as a member of US IG indices a long time ago and a member of high yield indices over the last 6 years. According to OTCStreaming170MUSD notional traded yesterday for a tenth of its cleared outstanding notional. The spread widened 6% upfront for hedging 5 year risk. The company department store business is struggling for a long time but according to the attached grapple, the company is moving from the high yield cluster to the distress cluster. The company has 2 billion USD liquidities. The management should not give up on trying to save the company, but they are all alone. The capital market is closed for JCP for some time.

Meanwhile, the credit index was weak. Gravity for credit is usually tighter due to the cost of carry. This is not the case at the moment . The gravity is fighting the end of august risk aversion and credit indices are failing to tighten on both sides of the pond.

"
"The Calm Before The Storm?. BRAZIL is wider just +4bp today, a move that is certainly not impressive, compared to its neighbor ARGENT (+15) or even TURKEY (+13). Similarly, BRAZIL has widened ‘only’ c60bp since mid-May, vs c250bp for TURKEY and c200bp for ARGENT. However, it is worth noting that the sentiment on Brazil is at risk, due to the coming general election in October. Indeed, the latest polls show that the Workers Party (‘PT’) is dominating with more than 37% of the votes. This party has lost investors’ confidence after Lula’s/Rousseff’s corruption scandals, which largely helped pushing the country into a two-year-long recession in 2014-16. Oppositely, the candidate felt as more market-friendly (namely Geraldo Alckmin) failed to gain in popularity, still below 5% of the votes, which makes him look non-eligible for the runoff. $BRL is at the highest in more than two years (just below 4.00), but as we are less than 50 days before the 1st round (Oct 7), it is fair to say that concerns over Brazil may grow by then. Some analysts (incl. BAML) forecast above-5 $BRL if the PT takes power again, especially as positioning looks light. The FX/CDS correlation is at the low end of the five-year range (<50%) and may reassert in case of stress, if recent history (2015/16) is any guide. Elsewhere it was a quiet session, CDS indices traded in tight ranges. Main/IG spread tightened back from 10bp+, as European stocks outperformed their US counterparts (SX5E +0.6% SPX +0.2%).
"
"Nulla Nuova, Buona Nova. 10y BTPs tightened another 8bp vs Bunds today, bringing the 1-week move to c25bp, while no fundamental good news regarding Italy has come on the wires. 5y sovereign CDS has tightened broadly in line (-9bp), taking the Italian financial complex tighter (MB/G/UCG/ISP -5/-4bp). Short-term technical factors including supply and carry have likely helped BTPs here. Indeed, we have c€7B of German supply across today (2y Schatz) and tomorrow (10y Bund) while supply in Italy will only start next week. Yesterday Moody’s announced that it will postpone its review from Sep 7 to ‘end-Oct at the latest’. Adding to that, the Italian Cabinet Secretary Giorgetti said he won’t rule out breaking the 3% budget deficit limit in 2019. Those aren’t good news but failed to hurt the rally. Next week, BTP supply is back (5s and 10s on Thu. Aug 30) to test appetite for Italian risk, and we may well see a correction wider. That would be consistent with the last 10 years’ seasonal pattern. Indeed, the BTP spread has tightened -2bp on average in AUG to widen back +6bp on average in SEP.
"
"To Good to Be True. The credit index market is priced to perfection. The investment grade (IG) indices, in the US and in Europe, are trading close to their fair values. In Europe,  Atlantia CDS is trading 25bps tighter and all the European CDS are trading better. Europe is closing the gap with the US. The normalization is underway. However, having the US IG credit index trading close to its fair value is more unusual.  The US credit index is usually trading with a premium, the index trading much tighter than its fair value. The US equity indices – Russel 2000 included - are hovering below their highest level ever. The credit indices are far from trading at their tightest levels. Looking at the index bases (how far the indices are trading from their fair values) and looking at the index absolute levels, the credit market is definitively not enjoying the equity market strength.
"
"Six Weeks. BRAZIL continued to widen today (+7bp), Lula polling 37%/39% recently, just six weeks before the General Election (1st round Oct 7 / 2nd round Oct 28). According to a law that he signed himself when he was still in office, Lula cannot take back power less than eight years after he finishes to serve his sentence (which he is still serving). One can imagine that the courts may overturn that ruling if he runs and wins, so the main question here is probably whether he can run, because if he runs, he will likely secure 35% while if his VP Haddad runs, he’s seen at only c13%. We will know by Sep 17th the latest. Many people ask whether BRAZIL is the new TURKEY, the answer is probably not, because its external position is more solid. That said, there risk on the upside on the CDS, which is now close to the YTD wide (now 270bp vs 282bp). Open Interest is decent (c$16.5B / biggest in EM), according to ICE clearing data which you can monitor on OTCStreaming. ARGENT (+10) is also wider in sympathy, 5y CDS is now back at 600bp. Elsewhere in EM, RUSSIA (+2) pared widening on RUB 2% sudden rally in London AM on CBR declaring it won’t buy FX on domestic market until end-SEP. SOAF (+6) widened up to 10bp and $ZAR rose up to c2% in London AM on the back of Trump's tweet that he's asked Pompeo to closely study the seizures/expropriations. It was a totally different story in Asia, where CHINA is still close to tights (<60bp) despite non-convincing trade talks.
"
"Same Headline, Opposite Moves. Today UCGIM (-6) was the best-performer in the Main index (ex ATLIM), while SOCGENSLAC (+7) was the worst performer. Those opposite moves were triggered by the same headline: “UniCredit Hired Rothschild to Work on Possible SocGen Deal”. That price action demonstrates that the merger is perceived as good news for UCG and bad news for SG, illustrating the aversion to Italian risk ahead of next month’s budget discussions. The fact that the 10y BTP/DBR spread stands just 10bp below its peak reached in May concurs with that observation. This is still early days (for reference, that deal was first rumoured two years ago), but the potential combined proforma would be close to being the largest European bank by total assets (c€2.1T, just behind BNP at c€2.3T). Elsewhere, it was a positive day for risk assets. The PBOC and (more importantly) Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole took the dollar down, pushing CDS indices tighter (esp. XOver -5bp), in sympathy with higher equities (SPX +0.6%) and commodities (BCOM +0.7%). 
"
"When There Is No Will. Since the Turkey tantrum which lasted a week is over, it has been one-way traffic in credit land. Since mid-August, CDXIG tightened in a straight line from 63bps to 59bps, while ITXEB went from 71bps to 65bps. If Turkey’s 5-year risk premium is almost 100bps tighter than its 558bps peak, it is still dangerously close to 500bps, and, at 472bps, it is 60% wider than its early August level. But the market is taking it in its stride. Even though geopolitical risks stubbornly refuse to go away at the moment in Emerging markets or in Europe, despite an issuance calendar that has been gradually building up recently and will only get heavier in September, investors have decided to focus on carry and the incoming roll. The perspective of two shortened weeks in a row – yesterday was a bank holiday in the UK, and next Monday is one in the US – is proving too much for them to buy protection. With the roll coming up and the rosy picture that US stocks are painting, it will take something quite left field to sell off hard in the near term.
"
"Are They Doomed?. Today, a broker published a research note on COFP ( Casino Guichard Perrachon SA ). They slashed their price target by 25% to current levels and highlighted the company’s weak cash flow generation. It triggered a 4% drop of COFP’s share price, and immediately worries about RALFP (Rallye) ability to service its debt resurfaced. Indeed, it sounds like double jeopardy for RALFP. It relies on COFP’s dividend as it main source of cash and that income stream could be under threat. If it effectively dries up, the company will have to borrow money as bonds it issued in the past will soon reach maturity (€970 are due early next year). In order to do that it will have to pledge the COFP shares it owns which value has plummeted (the stock of COFP is down 40% since the beginning of the year), potentially impairing its ability to do so. Even though RALFP’s CEO commented that he does not foresee any difficulty accessing the credit lines that require pledging COFP’s shares to draw down, investors’ unease was obvious. They sent RALFP’s 5-year risk premium 150bps wider. They now put the probability that RALFP defaults within 1 year at 29% and the probability that it defaults within 5 years at almost 80%.
"
"A Bridge Too Far. ASTIM’s () - the Italian company which mainly designs, develops and operates public infrastructure and large scale civil engineering works – has been in the news ever since it announced a loss related to soured investments in Venezuela last November. As you can see on the above grapple, credit investors have been embarked on a rollercoaster ride during that period. That all might be about to come to an end. To address its problems, the company has been trying to get a capital injection from outside investors, including IHI Corporation. A deal was reached, but it was conditional on the sale of ASTIM’s stake in a flagship bridge project spanning Istanbul’s Bosphorus. But, amid recent political turmoil in Turkey – its risk premium was another 29bps wider at 536bps today and the Lira down another 4% -, ASTIM has not received any binding offer yet. That is most likely the reason why a call was held between the company and its lenders on August 28th. According to Italian newspapers, the latter asked ASTIM to file for a court led restructuring. That was enough for investors to throw in the towel. They pushed ASTIM’s 1-year risk premium up almost 15pts to 43.5pts upfront, assessing its survival probability over the next 12 months at roughly 1 in 3.
"
"Not Sure They Want To Trust You. It was a predictably slow start to the week with the US out of the office today. Generally speaking, there was not a great deal of momentum on indices, but some of the names that kept market participants on their toes last week kept moving. Among them was COFP ( Casino Guichard Perrachon SA ), which got downgraded by one notch by S&P; from BB+ to BB . Last week, the company’s 5-year risk premium widened by 125bps to 588bps. While it was roughly stable today, the curve inverted as investors pushed short dated risk premia meaningfully wider. On a running spread basis, 1-year, 2-year and 3-year risk premia are trading at wider levels than the 5-year risk premium. This inversion of the curve is basically showing that investors are seriously questioning the accounts of the company. At “face value”, there should not be any shortfall of liquidity compared with the uses over the next few years. Despite Mr Lubek’s – COFP deputy financial officer - best effort – he was on TV today -, his message is not getting across.
"
"Back 20 Years. It was a mixed session with things moving in different directions. Stocks were heavy throughout without any obvious catalyst, while credit felt quite robust, especially in Europe where peripheral government spreads were led tighter by BTPs on reassuring Italian budget headlines which eventually gave a boost to financials. But generally speaking the activity on single reference entities is subdued ahead of the roll, with the notable exception of emerging market sovereigns. Argentina has been volatile, but since the beginning of the week, Indonesia has been stealing the show. Yesterday, it was the most actively traded of the CDXEM constituents according to ICE Clearing data - which you can monitor at OTC Streaming -, and today’s data, which will be available early in the afternoon tomorrow, will certainly show the same thing. The rupiah has led a drop in Asian currencies, and reached levels not seen since the 1998 financial crisis, even after Bank Indonesia aggressively hiked rates, made direct market interventions and introduced a slew of measures that includes more hedging tools. Concerns over emerging-market contagion and US trade disputes with China and Canada have discouraged risk taking and triggered Indonesian bond FX exposure. Indonesia’s 5-year risk premium has been the clear laggard among Asian sovereigns recently. While CDS referencing Indonesia could not find any taker at 115bps a fortnight ago, they have widened by 28bps to 142bps during the past 5 trading sessions.

"Power Corrupts Sometimes…  Moderates Often. Power corrupts, or so the old saying goes. Anyone watching the multitude of political dramas on television or reading about them in the papers may tend to agree. However, perhaps power also moderates. This trend towards moderation has been observed on occasion in Europe, with politicians previously considered firebrands tempering their views to economic and market reality once in power. We saw this with Syriza in Greece, and it is tempting to say this in the light of Italian risk. The latter received a shot in the arm from noise from the government that EU budget limits will be respected. Earlier in the week it was Giovanni Tria, Minister of the Economy, and now it is the turn of Matteo Salvini, Deputy Prime Minister, whose Lega party had been proposing a significant fiscal stimulus package. It is too early to be drawing a line under the Italian budget as details are sparse and commitments vague, but investors’ perception was that Italian risk maybe receding. After topping 290bps at the end of August, the BTP/Bund spread closed at 255bps tonight, and Italy’s 5-year risk premium came down 20bps to 237bps over the same period.
"
"CBR Is Not CBRT. CDX EM squeezed another -7bp today, making it potentially vulnerable to the $200B tariffs and NFPs. ADP came indeed weaker than expected, but the ADP-NFP link has proven tricky lately (average 70k spread on the past 3 prints). EM single-name CDS were broadly in line with the index, contrary to the Argentina-led moves seen WTD, as today’s move was more the result of various idiosyncratic stories. 

ARGENT (-60bp) indeed continued its rally as the IMF has moved surprisingly quickly to present the proposal to its board. SOAF (-12bp) as Q2 CAD was ‘less bad than’ Q1 (still high @ 3.3% GDP, and vulnerable if precious downtrend extends). BRAZIL (-10bp), as PT almost seems out of the race now Lula cannot run. That said, there are many undecided (20-25%) and the far-right candidate is polling 22%. Today’s outlier was RUSSIA (+6bp), wider on Medvedev comments which sounded like pressure on CBR, the ‘spy headline’, and the post-inventory 2.5% oil drop. On the former, I believe that the CBR (Russia) should not be compared too closely to the CBRT (Turkey). CBR’s independence is all relative, but their historical hike in Dec-14 and Nabiullina as a governor have strengthened their credibility. Beyond next week’s meeting (Sep 14), it will be worth watching whether the CBR extends its pause in foreign currency purchases post Sep 28. Elsewhere, CDS indices kept outperforming stocks, and the Main/IG spread kept tightening (back below 5bp for the first time since early August).

"
"A Bottomless Pit?. It was another day of grind tighter for financial credit indices. Itraxx Financial Senior (ITXES) and iTraxx Financial Subordinated (ITXEU) both closed 1bps tighter at 76bps and 161bps respectively. It took place despite an oversized move wider in the 5-year risk premium of DANBNK ( Danske Bank A/S ). It came under fresh pressure today after the Wall Street Journal reported an investigation into the money laundering scandal at its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015 involved $150Bln worth of transactions. On Tuesday, the Financial Times cited the bank’s own investigation as saying the Danish bank handled up to $30Bln of Russian and ex-Soviet money through non-resident accounts via its Estonian branch in 2013 alone. Back then, DANBNK’s hardly reacted to the headline. Even though the bank said its investigators had not determined whether all of the $150Bln should be deemed suspicious, it also admitted that “as we have previously communicated, it is clear that the issue related to the portfolio (are) bigger than we previously anticipated”. That was enough to send 5-year CDS referencing its senior debt 15bps wider at 64bps and CDS referencing its subordinated debt 59bps wider at 175bps.
"
"Another Day, Another Rip. Once again credit indices produced another impressive performance today. With the exception of CDXEM which tracks emerging markets’ sovereigns, all indices closed tighter (iTraxx Main -3.5bps @ 61bps; iTraxx Fin Snr -5.5bps @ 71bps; iTraxx Crossover -8bps @ 280bps; CDXIG -2bps @ 58bps; CDXHY -6bps @ 326bps). Everything Italian was pushed tighter by the BTP’s rally (-13bps @ 2.91%) which followed the declaration on Sunday by Finance Minister Giovanni Tria that the Italian government knows it must cut its debt load and keep the budget deficit in check in order to promote growth and gradually implement its spending program. “It makes no sense to seek two or three billion euros of extra deficit if we then have to pay three or four billion more due to higher yield” on government bonds, he said. But the outperformance was not due to Italy alone. UK names also joined the party after European Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier struck an optimist tone as he said a deal on the UK’s orderly withdrawal from the bloc was possible within six to eight weeks. UK financials, which have had a bumpy ride over the last fortnight, extended Friday’s gains and were the best performers in their sector.
"
"Towards A Kolossal Bank?. Many have been thinking that the global dominance of US banks in the era of Donald Trump should stir Europe’s banks into joining forces and gaining scale. Many names have been flying around over the last few months. UCGIM ( UniCredit SpA ) was said in June to be weighing a deal with SOCGEN ( Societe Generale SA ) and would now be considering BBVA ( Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA ) as a potential target. Today another rumour gained traction, as it was reported in Der Spiegel that the German government would be open to tie-up between CMZB ( Commerzbank AG) – in which it still holds a 15.5% stake - and DB (Deutsche Bank AG). Speculation about the two banks merging has been bubbling over the last few months after DB’s Supervisory Board Chairman was said to have discussed the idea with German officials. Even if DB is still in the process of integrating Postbank and if its CEO said internally that a merger would not happen in the next 18 months, investors gave the story enough credit to push DB’s 5-year risk premium 7bps tighter at 123bps and CMZB’s 4bps wider at 78bps, initiating a potential convergence process which made them respectively the best and worst performer among European banks today.
"
"Spring Cleaning In September. Today was an interesting day for credit indices in Europe. Not really in terms of trading, as they all remained in tight ranges, only giving up a small portion of their recent gains. But Markit published the lists of provisional constituents of the different iTraxx indices. The composition of Crossover (ITXEX) was of particular interest after the many complaints made by index users regarding the basket of the existing series, the series 29. Indeed, it included a number of names that effectively never trade, which made it a fairly difficult instrument to use. The illiquidity of the underlying basket was evidenced by inability of the arbitragers’ community to take advantage of the wild moves of the ITXEX29 basis during the summer. That should all change with the new series, the series 30, which will see a change in the name selection methodology. The minimum spread requirement has been dropped for rated entities, and the main selection criteria for inclusion in ITXEX have now shifted to CDS liquidity. This has expanded the available universe to several BBB- names. One of the results will be a somewhat tighter risk premium compared to series 29, but most importantly the underlying basket will be much cleaner. Steinhoff, Crown European Holdings, Dufry, OI, Nidda Healthcare, Bevco Lux, Verisure, Arcelor Mittal and Europcar are shown the exit, while Clariant, CNH Industrial, Evraz Group, GKN, Metsa, NXP, Schaeffler, Smurfit Kappa and Stora are making their way in.

"Kind Reminder. TURKEY 5y CDS was slightly tighter in London AM, until Erdogan said 'we should cut this high interest rate'. That sent TURKEY wider +25bp, less than two hours before the rate decision. Funnily enough, he quickly reminded that this was only his view and that the central bank (CBRT) was still independent… Slightly after noon, the CBRT hiked its 1w repo rate by 625bp, while the consensus was expecting 325bp. The effective hike is closer to 475bp than 625bp, because the 1w repo facility is shut (only the o/n one works), but that was enough to send $TRY 7% lower. The softer-than-expected US CPI and the non-eventful European central banks’ meetings helped that move to consolidate in London PM. The 5y CDS closed -55bp on the day, -80bp from the intraday top. That is a strong improvement for Turkey in the near term, but that is only the monetary side of the equation. On the fiscal side, we should get the medium-term programme delivered by the government before the end of SEP. That development saw CDXEM tighter -13bp, while the skew kept in the range, consistently with other recent ample Turkey-led moves we have had (especially at the beginning of AUG). The rest of the EM complex followed suit, especially SOAF (-15), the most correlated one. The outlier was LEBANON (+20), as market-makers got lifted in the short end.

"Let’s Hope Florence Is Kinder Than Irma. September is usually when we begin to hear about the hurricane season, and this year is no exception. 2017 was marked by the devastating impact of Irma in the Caribbean. Over the last few days, we have heard a lot about Florence, the hurricane which made landfall overnight near Wrightsville Beach in North Carolina and has begun to batter the region with water and wind. While most forecasts suggest a rapidly deceleration, the biggest peril is likely flooding with the storm remaining over North Carolina for several days. When compared to Houston which was struck by hurricane Harvey last year, the region has a lower population density, which should mean a lower financial cost. However, a larger portion of North Carolina is covered by private flood insurance. Hence a higher portion of the economic loss is likely to be insured. That is the why, even if the risk premia of insurers and reinsurers have been well behaved given the relatively low levels of hurricane activity thus far this year, they have been put under a bit of pressure since the beginning of the week. The sector is accustomed to this kind of phenomenon and the associated underperformance usually does not last, but you can clearly see on the above grapple that Insurers and Reinsurers underperformed other Financials during the past 5 trading sessions.

"Banks To The Rescue. As you can see on the above grapple, investors suspected RALFP’s ( Rallye SA ) management would not sit on their hands and would react to the vicious recent price action of the company’s risk premium. COFP’s ( Casino Guichard Perrachon SA ) parent company announced over the week-end that it had signed a new bank credit line of 500M€ with five banks maturing in June 2020. More importantly, to draw down from this new credit line, RALFP does not need to pledge shares of COFP as collateral. For now, this new financing may resolve the liquidity issue RALFP would otherwise be facing in March 2019 as, depending on COFP’s share price, drawing on cheaper existing collateralised credit line might not be a possibility. Overall, RALFP has gained time and successfully closed the door on the talk of immediate default or debt restructuring – RALFP’s bond maturing in 4 weeks which was offered at 95% of face value last week was bid at 99.5% today. However, if bank financing is a good short-term option, it is not a long-term solution. The company has obviously reassured credit investors, but it will need to access the bond market at some point and it will not be able to do so unless it resolves its indebtedness issue.
"
"Mind The Optionality. Today was another session where the attention of most investors was firmly on the roll which comes on Thursday. An overwhelming majority of the trades done at the moment consists in shifting positions from the current 5-year maturity (Jun23) to the next on the run 5-year maturity (Dec23). Nevertheless, there are pockets of activity, and news that PRUFIN ( Prudential Plc ) has mandated 6 banks as joint-lead managers to arrange a series of bond issues caught investors’ attention. Benchmark Tier 2 transactions are expected in GBP (one with a 33-year maturity non-callable for 13 years and one with a 50-year maturity non-callable for 30 years) and in USD (with a 30-year maturity non-callable for 10 years). While it increases the likelihood that the market sees a consent solicitation on existing securities which should be a positive, the new notes will feature an option to substitute the issuer for a newly established holding company of the M&G; Prudential business. Hence it opens the door for a succession event on CDS currently referencing PRUFIN. As a result, even if the 5-year risk premium of PRUFIN’s senior debt closed unchanged on the day, the 5-year risk premium of its subordinated debt was pushed 6bps wider at 90bps.
"
"The Wait Is Over. Today was option expiry day but it was a rather benign session with respect to late hedging activity, and the trading ranges on all indices were extremely narrow. Once again, the attention of investors was firmly on the roll, and very little directional positioning took place. In the face of a buyers’ strike, bid/offer spreads of protection markets have opened significantly over the last couple of weeks. It was even more obvious today on the eve of the roll, as no one wanted to buy CDS contracts that will not be “on-the-run” tomorrow. It was true for single reference CDS and also stood for indices. Everyone has been waiting for the shiny new toys they will be given tomorrow, and volumes were low. After a few days of anaemic activity, the general feeling is that trading will resume in earnest when the new index series are available. Fingers crossed…
"
"Mind The Gap. Today was the roll day for all iTraxx/CDX indices, except the CDX HY. This was the main focus, pushing traded volumes high (IG $46B Main $30B Xover $19B). The iTraxx Main roll was stable throughout the session (c9bp in 5s c7bp in 10s). In contrast, the iTraxx Xover roll traded in the mid -7s region during the European session but once the US came in, flows became one-way, pulling it below -9bp. That move let us feel like preemptively existing long-risk positions on Xover s29 got rolled onto the new series, despite the difference of spread between the two. The chart above might let us feel like credit is wider today because of the roll impact, however today was a clearly risk-on session which saw CDS indices tighten and US equity indices reach new record highs. 
"
"Sweet Pain. While SZUGR ( Suedzucker AG ) had benefitted from the general move tighter ahead of the roll, it looks like a completely different today and the relentless widening of its 5-year risk premium resumed in earnest last week. On Thursday, the company cut its profit forecast, citing a “difficult environment” which sounds like an understatement. Europe’s sugar industry is suffering from the lowest prices in a decade. The market is in oversupply because of record crops in India and Thailand, while at the same time prices are further depressed by the fall of the currency of the world’s biggest exporter, Brazil. Raw sugar prices have fallen off a cliff since the beginning of the year. They have plunged 22%. White sugar, into which European beets are processed, has dropped 16% in 2018. SZUGR is particularly vulnerable to these swings as 30% of its core sugar sales are based on spot price, mostly in Europe. The company’s operating profit could plunge by more than 75% in the fiscal year ending in February 2019. Since the January 1st, SZUGR’s 5-year risk premium has tripled.

"Is Life Coming Back To Some Forgotten Crossover Names?. PPCGA (Public Power Corporation) provides electricity services. It distributes electricity in Greece to residential, commercial and industrial customers. The company, which is 51% state-owned, had been forced to make provisions for overdue bills left unpaid in its austerity-hit country in recent years. The provisions dropped considerably after the utility hired an adviser to help it collect the arrears, and it helped PPCGA to report a smaller first-half loss this morning. Once a monopoly, the company also announced they had lost market share in the retail market under a bailout-mandated plan Greece adopted to open up the sector to competition. First half revenue decreased 6.8% to €2.2Bln. Most importantly to CDS traders, they clearly stated that they will be looking to come to the bond market. Once considered an entity that could be orphaned, the news repriced its 5-year risk premium substantially wider. The prospect of more and longer debt deliverable into CDS contracts send PPCGA’s 5-year risk premium 139bps wider at 388bps. There obviously can be life in some of the least traded Crossover names.
"
"All Eyes On Italy. Today not just Italy CDS but all European CDS indices tracked the BTP/DBR spread: wider at the open and reverting tighter post BTP auction. The initial widening happened due to the delay in the budget meeting. Then the 5y/10y auction was strong (highest b2c since May) as locals rushed to add duration at this level. BTP/DBR kept tightening post auction mainly due to the Bund leg (German Sep CPI 2.3%y v 2.0%y exp). Budget-wise, ANSA just reported 2.4-2.5%, which feels close to expectation, but today’s cabinet meeting (currently going on) still to confirm… Anything closer to 3% will be negative, as risk will be on the upside thereafter. In the initial selloff, it is worth noting that iTraxx XOver performed in line with iTraxx Main, contrasting with the XO/Main outperformance on Italy-led selloffs last summer. Outside of Europe, it was also a decently risk-on session, as yesterday’s not-dovish-not-hawkish FOMC came as a relief for EM and US risky assets.
"
"A Default Within Ten Days Of The Crossover Launch. In creditland, Italy was decisively in the news today, and not only because the country’s budget plans put its government on a collision course with the European Union. ASTIM (Astaldi) announced this morning that they filed for creditor protection (concordato preventive), which allows the company to continue as a going concern. The question for the CDS community is whether or not this will trigger a bankruptcy event, and it appears that opinions are split on the subject. In any case, it is worth highlighting that there are subtle differences in how “bankruptcy” is defined depending on whether your CDS contract is governed by the 2003 or the 2014 definitions. Under the 2003 definitions, a proceeding seeking relief under bankruptcy law constitutes “bankruptcy”, provided it is not dismissed of course. Under the 2014 definitions, only proceedings seeking a similar relief to a judgement of insolvency constitutes “bankruptcy”. The ISDA Decision Committee might therefore decides different outcomes for the 2 types of contracts. But even if the DC rules that this is not a bankruptcy credit event under 2014 documentations, it will not be the end of the story. Coupons are due soon on some of ASTIM’s bonds. CDS investors will be scrutinising payment dates and grace periods. The iTraxx Crossover could become a 74-member-index in the not too distant future.

"It Is The Investment Grade Corporates, Stupid!. Recently much had been said about Italy after they unveiled plans for a substantial budget deficit last week. Consequently, Mr Tria was greeted with little enthusiasm from his European colleagues and the market alike. The yield differential between the interest rates Italy and Germany have to pay to finance themselves over 10 years reached 283bps today. Unsurprisingly Italian financials reacted poorly and generally speaking iTraxx Financials has been under pressure. Consistently, iTraxx Financials Subordinated (+10.5bps over the last week) has underfperformed iTraxx Financials Senior (+4.5bps). What surprised some is the fact that despite the underperformance of its financial constituents, iTraxx Main (ITXEB) is 2.5bps tighter on a one-week horizon and that it has outperformed massively iTraxx Crossover which is 2bps wider. The bottom line is that no one feels the need to buy protection on investment grade corporates in the current environment. What is true in Europe is also obvious in the US. People who are scratching their heads when they look at the relentless tightening of ITXEB should take a look at CDX IG which does not include any bank. During the last five trading sessions, the risk premium of the US investment grade credit benchmark has tightened by 5bps to 58bps, outperforming ITXEB by 2.5bps.
"
"Still Investment Grade, But For How Long?. Despite its 126-year history, GE ( General Electric Company ) is very much a work in progress, and people fear it may take years to reset its discipline and culture. The company announced yesterday that it had ousted its CEO and hired Larry Culp, a turnaround expert, to replace him. Along with announcing the new CEO, GE said profit this year will miss forecast as its GE Power business has been performing worse than it had expected and will generate less cash flow than its prior forecast. The rating agencies all cited the performance of that business, which builds turbines for power plants, as a reason for potential reviews for downgrade. In fact, today, S&P; decided it was time to act and they revised GE’s rating down to BBB+. Business metrics are still poor, and some reckon that the negative rating cycle which has knocked off three notches in less than a year – GE was still a AA- company in October 2017 – could continue. Investors showed their caution by pushing its 5-year risk premium 13bps wider to 84bps.

"No Doubt - Yellen Is Gone. Chair Powell sounded hawkish yesterday in DC. He said that rates are still accommodative here, that the neutral rate is still far, that they may eventually go past neutral, even if it starts restraining growth. Eight months later, no doubt, Janet Yellen is gone. The speech came after strong ISM/ADP data yesterday, taking $ / $ rates higher and CDS indices wider. US indices underperformed European ones, while BTP/DBR spreads stabilised across the curve. In the US, CDX HY underperformed IG, HY spread trades near 340bp for the first time since July. VolumesTreasury futures (TY) will be at focus tomorrow again, with the US employment report to come. Specs have built TY shorts in the 119-16/118-16 area, meaning they are +/- all in profit, as we trade south 118. Such a crowded positioning might let us see a profit-taking-led rally from here (320 on 10s)… Tomorrow, the focus will be on average hourly earnings, the Bloomberg consensus expects 2.8%y from 2.9%y.

"UK Banks Outperform On Improved Brexit Sentiment. Danske Bank (DANBNK) and Italian names led losses in the iTraxx Senior Financial index today. DANBNK (SLAC +11 SUB +22) widened after FT suggested it executed €8.5B mirror trades for Russian clients in just one year (not all necessarily suspicious). The Danish bank announced that it has increased its capital target to 16% from 14-15%, after the regulator has doubled the Pillar 2 add-on from 70bp to 130bp, and stopped its 2018 share buyback program (~40bp in CET1 impact). The stock has fallen -43% since MAR... A wider 10y BTP/DBR caused Italian fins to lag (+5/+8 in sen +9/+15 in sub). Those names are likely to remain under pressure from budget-related headlines. At the opposite end of the spectrum, UK banks outperformed (flattish on day) on continued positive Brexit news. Indeed the EU is set to offer the UK a free-trade deal deeper than any agreement that's gone before but will reject May's demand for frictionless trade. The EU's vision for its future ties with the UK will reportedly contain ""c30-40%"" of May's pitch for a wide-ranging trade and security deal. Another step toward soft Brexit?

"More Dispersion To Come?. The credit market loves an excuse to be quiet and with the US out for Columbus Day, the set-up was perfect for a dozy trading session. It was not the case though, as the weakness that we saw overnight in Asia fed through Autos/Metals and Miners pushing both sectors 3 to 5bps wider on average, while comments from Italian leaders criticising the EU approach towards Italy set the tone for weaker peripheral corporates’ risk premia. Throw into the mix a few idiosyncratic news: MTNLN (Matalan), the value-apparel retailer, posted solid results for the second quarter with 1% revenue growth and relatively flat EBITDA despite warn weather and sporting events dampening customer demand subsequently sending its risk premium 56bps tighter at 1074bps – yes, that is still roughly 17% upfront plus 500bps running -; PPCGA (Public Power Corporation), the Greek utility, announced it had secured “a significant extension” of its debt obligations by signing 2 loan agreements with banks in order to refinance two syndicated bond loans totalling €1.3Bln sending its risk premium 107bps tighter at 282bps; CABBCO (Monitchem HoldCo), the chemical manufacturer, announced a failure of one of the two transformers of its electrolysis plant in Switzerland and sent out a profit warning pushing its risk premium 27bps wider at 406bps; LOUDRE (Louis Dreyfus) announced lower income than analysts were expecting sending its risk premium 47bps wider at 299bps. That definitely made for a busy day, and many took it as a sign there could be more dispersion to come.

"Roaring Wider. It was a mixed session with BTPs, stocks and rates sending contradicting signals throughout the day. In credit, there was a constant theme though, as investors sold risk on higher beta auto and autopart related names. The sector has been heavy for a couple of days, a phenomenon that was pinned down to the upcoming EU environment ministers meeting to discuss emission caps, which is widely expected to result in a push for a more ambitious set of rules. It culminated this morning in a proper battering of TTMTIN (Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc) which saw its 5-year risk premium marked 45bps wider at the open. This aggressive move followed the September sales numbers reported by the company. The year-on-year decline amounts to 12.3%, as strong sales for new models were offset by weakness in China where demand dropped 46.2% on the back of import duty changes and continued trade tensions. This came exactly a month after Ralf Speth, the CEO, warned that a hard Brexit would cost the company £1.2Bln a year and would wipe out its profits. The company also confirmed the two-week temporary closure of its Solihull factory, which employs almost a quarter of the group’s workforce in the UK. Some profit taking on short risk positions eventually emerged at the end of the session and limited the widening of TTMTN’s 5-year risk premium to 28bps at 485bps, but the negative trend of the past nine months which is obvious on the above grapple  shows no sign of abating and is in fact gathering momentum since the roll.

"Still Only An Equity Story. It was not a good day for stock investors, as all major indices lost in the region of 2%. The pain for equity holders of luxury good companies begun a few days ago, when rumours of tighter control by Chinese customs agency on its citizens at border points first surfaced. These were confirmed by Jean-Jacques Guiony, LVHM’s ( LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton ) Chief Financial Officer, during a call with analysts this morning. He said China is effectively stepping up border checks on returning travellers in a crackdown on undeclared imports. His comments fuelled alarm among investors, even though the company reported a quarterly sales increase in line with forecasts. Louis Vuitton sales growth to Chinese shoppers has slowed slightly, but still stands in the mid-teens. But it looks as if people were just looking for excuses to take profit in one of the few sectors that has not had a correction yet. The stock lost 7% on the day and is 14% of its recent peak. While the rout extended to equities of the whole luxury sector, their credit risk premia were left almost unchanged. LVMH’s CDS closed at 37bps, only 5bps wider from its tightest level of the year.

"Crash Test For US Autos. Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) have seen their credit spreads under upward pressure this week, clearly underperforming the broader US IG sector (cf. chart above). Their respective stock prices are also near their lowest levels since the end of 2012... 

The main trigger for that move has probably been declining sales in September, especially in China due to trade issues. Ford posted an 11% decline in US sales in September versus consensus of down 9.1%. Last week, F said metal tariffs cost it ~$1bn in profit in 18 vs previous guidance of ~$600M. Other factors include higher rates impact consumers’ demand for new cars down, higher raw material prices (without counting the steel & aluminium tariffs). Adding to that trend, a few brokers are now UW on the sector. Ford’s downgrade by Moody’s from Baa2 to Baa3 (adding a relatively unexpected negative outlook on top of that) at the end of August was already setting the stage for a choppy end of the year. In this market, talks (if any) between the US and its main partners will be closely watched...

"The End Of The Original Everything Store. More than a century ago, SRAC (Sears, Roebuck and Co.) pioneered the strategy of selling everything to everyone. It all came to an abrupt end today, as the company filed for bankruptcy ahead of a $134mln payment that was coming due. It is using a chapter 11 filing in Federal Bankruptcy Court in New York to cut its debt load and keep operating at least through the holidays. The company eventually succumbed to the competition of online retailers. It has roughly $5.6Bln in outstanding debt and has dwindled down to about 820 Sears and Kmart stores, from 2000 five years ago. The company was taken over by Eddie Lampert a few years ago, and he had often attempted to keep SRAC viable with loans and audacious financial engineering. He spun numerous assets off from the retailer into separate companies that his hedge fund - ESL Investments – invests in. But while many of these spin offs flourished, SRAC slid toward insolvency. It will be the first default among the constituents of the 3 most recent series of CDX HY.

"Do Trucks Pollute As Much As Cars?. Until now, truck makers had largely escaped the scrutiny that put car manufacturers on the defensive since the Volkswagen diesel-emissions scandal erupted in 2015. In fact, studies showed that modern trucks are surprisingly clean… if all their components function properly. VLVY ( Volvo AB ), the Swedish truck maker, announced this morning it has detected problems with an emission control component, which is “degrading more quickly than expected”, resulting in engines exceeding limits for nitrogen oxides. The degradation which “is due to a materials issue that occurs over time (…) does not affect all vehicles and engines in the same way and to the same extent”. The cost to fix the problem with the part, which comes from an outside supplier, could be “material” but is therefore difficult to assess at this stage according to the company. Crucially for VLVY, its trucks’ emission problems are not due to deliberate manipulation, but the news certainly spooked investors. They sent VLVY’s 5-year risk premium 14bps wider at 83bps, the widest it has been since the very end of 2016.

"Going Through A Soft Patch. SOFTBK ( Softbank Group Corp ) depends on Saudi money more than other firms. Almost half of the money invested in its Vision Fund, the biggest tech investment vehicle in the world, was provided by the Middle Eastern kingdom.  The fund has already invested billions of dollars in businesses and SOFTBK’s founder said it plans to raise similarly sized funds every few years. The political pressure currently applied on Saudi Arabia following the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week is definitely a worry for the company. Although its COO said it is business as usual at companies backed by the Vision Fund, he also said he is “anxiously looking at what is happening”. Indeed, SOFTBK may find it difficult to distance itself from Saudi Arabia given their strong financial ties. It could make some start-ups reluctant to accept the Vision Fund’s money, and it could also make raising capital for future funds more difficult. Over the last week, investors have gradually pushed SOFTBK’s 5-year risk premium wider. From a recent tight of 175bps, it now trades at 195bps.

"There We Go Again. Today Italy 5y CDS widened to the highest since H1-2013, after the European Commission said that the Italian populists’ spending plans are excessive and asked for an explanation. The EC likely dislikes not only the deviation, but also the fact that the deviation is planned to persist through time, as opposed to a one-off. That took us to 327 on the 10y BTP-Bund spread. What now? The Italian government has received a letter from the EU, requesting changes to its draft budget plan by OCT 22. Then, S&P; and Moody’s are due to review their respective ratings before the end of this month. As I write Italy is still BBB(=) / BBB(-) / Baa2 (-). A big question is whether the next rating reviews will lead the BTPs out of the mainstream € bond IG indices. In terms of index inclusion, you need 4 cumulative notches of downgrades to get out of the Bloomberg-Barclays index. With 2 notches by both S&P; and Moody’s, BTPs also exit the Citi index. The barrier is higher (5 notches) to see BTPs kicked out of the Markit iBoxx and ICE indices. 

A decent part of this downgrade/index risk is already priced in, which does not mean we cannot go wider. My view on Italy has not changed since my AUG 3 post, as I do not see catalysts to go significantly tighter from here. I think that the Italian government is unlikely to backtrack easily unless the markets put more pressure on them. Remember they have the EU elections next year. Looking at recent polls, PD + Forza Italia represent less than a quarter of Italian voters, which also tells me that the probability of a snap election before year-end (i.e. when a budget must be passed) is low. Adding to that, risk premia globally seem on the way higher, the ECB’s PSPP net purchases are set to stop at the end of this year.

"Back From The Dead. Back in July, SVU (Supervalu Inc.) agreed to be sold to another food wholesaler, United Natural Foods Inc, in a $2.9Bln deal, after it spent the last decade trying to overcome the downturn’s effect on the huge bet it made when it bought more 1,100 stores from Albertsons in 2006 for $12Bln. This summer’s deal sent the risk premium of CDS referencing SVU tumbling tighter as investors expected it to become an empty shell from a debt point of view. Last week the deal was approved, and SVU’s risk premium hardly reacted. United Natural Foods is currently trying to lure investors to a nearly $2Bln loan backing its buyout of SVU. It had to revise the terms with investor-friendly changes compared with what was originally whispered after the release of deteriorating earnings by both retailers, and SVU’s risk premium hardly reacted. What really got it going was the mention in the final documentation of the loan published today that SVU would be a co-borrower. All of a sudden it was no longer a dead box. While its 5-year CDS was trading at 190bps on the 18th of October, it closed double that tonight at 379bps.

"Copy That?. Earlier in the year, the control of XRX ( Xerox Corp ) was handed to activist investors Icahn and Deason, after its planned merger with Fuji was scrapped. The company delivered today its first set of results under their guidance, and they were consistent with granting top priority to shareholder returns. The US photocopier which is facing a long running decline in its core business reported net profit that roughly halved and said revenue fell 5.8% year on year to $2.35Bln in the third quarter, below an average analyst estimate of $2.42Bln. Despite that fall, the new management increased its share-repurchase expectations by $200m, even though according to the different rating agencies, XRX does not have any further flexibility within its current BBB rating category. Investors certainly copied that, and sent XRX’s 5-year risk premium 27bps at 224bps.

"You Only Live Twice. Turkey 5y CDS got tighter another c10bp today, bringing the rally since the end of August to 170bp, on the 5y CDS. In the same time, $TRY got down c15%. The two key developments which have helped that reversal were 1/ the Sept 13 CBRT rate hike to 24% (nominal…) and 2/ the freeing of the Pastor Brunson, the cornerstone of the US-Turkey diplomatic relationships.  
Given short positioning, the path of least pain was for Turkish assets to rally, after those two developments. Today the CBRT stood pat on rates, as widely expected by both economists and the short end. The market prices nothing for the next three months and then less than 300bp of hikes for the twelve following months. Given how close to zero TRY rates are, given its trade deficits, and given its political leadership, Turkey remains seen as vulnerable in the medium term. And the CBRT might need to hike more aggressively than the markets currently price in, to reward adequately TRY holders for the risk they take.

"Don’t Let The Engine Stall. China first overtook the US as the world’s largest car market in 2009. By then, the country’s economic boom had started creating a new middle class eager to get on the road and show their improved status. It has now become by far the biggest growth engine of almost all car manufacturers. VW, BMW, Daimler, Jaguar Land Rover all have large joint ventures there, and China is a key market for all of them. That is no surprise that all of them reacted positively after it was reported that China is considering slashing tax on cars. Vehicles with engines no bigger than 1.6 litres would see tax fall from 10% to 5%. The move is intended to shore up a market which is facing its first decline since the beginning of the century in the midst of an escalating trade war with the US. Even though the move was not officially confirmed, cars of that engine size account for 70% of passenger vehicles sold, and investors expect the impact to be substantial. They sent the risk premia of all members of the automotive sector tighter, from VW (-8bps @ 104bps) to Schaeffler (-20bps @ -158bps), and made the latter the best performing sector in credit today.

"Powering Wider. The reporting season is nearing to an end and most companies have already announced their results for the third quarter. This morning, it was the turn of GE ( General Electric Company ), the embattled industrial giant, to release their earnings. And they were not good. After revenues declined from $30.66Bln to $29.57Bln, which was short of analysts’ expectations, the company said it will likely miss its full-year earnings targets due to problems with the power generation and slashed its quarterly dividend to a penny from 12cts a share. A $22Bln charge related to the power division was announced. Worryingly for investors, the management announced that federal regulators are looking into its accounting practices over the $22Bln write down. The SEC is already looking into how GE took a $15Bln hit after one of its subsidiaries, North American Life and Health, miscalculated the cost for the care of people who lived longer than projected. And the company said in February that the Department of Justice may take action in connection to an investigation into GE’s subprime mortgage loans business. GE’s stock got hammered and traded at levels not seen since 2009. While GE’s 5-year risk premium is still a long long way away from the 750bps at which it traded that same year, it was pushed 19bps wider at 127bps, the widest it has been since 2012.

"Lighter Is Faster. Boparan Finance PLC (BOPRLN) tightened c60bp today, thus the best performer in iTraxx XOver, itself tighter c5bp due to stronger risk sentiment. This is after BOPRLN agreed to sell its Manton Wood sandwich business to Samworth Brothers. This new step in asset sales takes the total amount to £350M for the last 3 transactions. In short, that means largely enough cash to pay down the 5 ¼ 2019s (£250M). We may learn more on whether they pay 2019s early when we get their FY results (NOV 20). Therefore the cash yield curve massively bull steepened today (5 ¼ 19s -380bp 5 ½ 21s -105bp). Indeed, the question will likely become how will they pay the £600M of 21s. To answer this question, we will need to see other non-core asset disposals. The main candidates there include Foxes Biscuits, Donegal Catch (frozen fish), Holland Pies (pies and puddings) and the Christmas Pudding business.

Elsewhere it has been a decently risk-on session which saw CDS indices tighten (Main -2.5 XOver -5.2 CDXIG -3.1 CDXHY -13.5) and shares rally (SPX +1.9% SXXP +1.7%), partially reversing OCT widening/losses.

"LBO Risks Gathering. In August, ARNC ( Arconic Inc ) announced it was considering selling its building and construction systems unit which makes facades, windows and framing products. On Tuesday, when it reported better than expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year earnings forecast, it said the sale process was under way and had drawn robust interest. Under such circumstances, one would probably expect ARNC’s risk premium to tighten. But during the same earning meeting, the management also announced that the scope of the strategy and portfolio review initiated in February was being extended and its scope broadened “to address additional scenarios”. That gave weight to rumours that private equity firms are circling the company, with Apollo Global Management supposedly about to make an offer in excess of $11bln for the aluminium products maker. With LBO risks gathering and leverage potentially about to be propelled higher, investors in fact pushed ARNC’s 5-year risk premium above 400bps for the first time since 2016. 
"
"Stressed By Brexit?. Late on Friday, the Eu’s banking watchdog – the European Banking Authority - published results for its toughest stress tests since 2009, when it began the exercise in order to identify capital deficiencies and avoid any repeat of the government bailouts triggered by the 2008 financial crisis. These tests assume scenarios with shocks such as years of negative economic growth, weak bank profitability, a sell-off in government bonds and real estate, against a backdrop of political and Brexit uncertainty. They have no pass or fail grade but offer investors the ability to see how each of the 48 institutions involved fares relative to its peers. People keep a close eye on them because they help supervisors determine if banks need to raise more capital, sell risky assets or curb their dividend. While all the banks had enough capital to withstand even the harshest outcomes, BACRPLC ( Barclays Plc ) and LLOYDSGR ( Lloyds Banking Group Plc ) unexpectedly came in among the worst performers. Even if both banks declared that they are comfortable with their current capital position, their risk premia came under pressure today and they were the laggards in the financial sector.

"Mid-Term Pause. The election cycle in the US means we are never too far away from either a presidential or a mid-term election. Preparation also seems to go on for an age, such that it is a wonder politicians actually have any time left to govern, and the fervour generated at political rallies is something quite impressive. But, as far as they are concerned, during the few sessions heading into mid-term election day, markets have been focusing elsewhere. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the vote – will the  Republicans retain the senate? will the Democrats regain control of the House -, markets have in general been focusing elsewhere and were busy erasing most of the risk premia widening that we experienced since the beginning of October. Today was no different and all credit indices put in a decent performance, but volumes were thin and stood at roughly half what they usually are. Investors still assume the probability of a sharp sell-off is restricted, but they also suspect the outcome of the US mid-term elections is likely to provide some noise. They decided against going all in… yet.
"
"No Retroactive Punishment. A couple of weeks ago, Spanish banks experienced a few torrid sessions after a ruling said that they should be retroactively liable over four years for mortgage stamp duty payments.  The decision would have cost them €5Bln. Overnight, it was announced that the Supreme Court had reversed the decision, and that home buyers would not be reimbursed their taxes and should actually keep footing the bill in the future. Investors’ reaction was very positive and protection for Spanish banks went bidless. But soon after, in response to the popular and political outrage that followed the decision, the government said that Spain will change its mortgage law, and that it will make banks pay the tax from the moment it publishes a decree on the matter. That somewhat dampened investors’ mood. Profit takers that had held long risk positions emerged to take chips off the table, and risk premia eventually stabilised. It is widely expected that banks will just raise fees or adjust mortgage interest to neutralise the measure, which means we are roughly back to where we were mid October.  
"
"Oil Down, Drillers Tighter?. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC) is tighter -21bp since Tuesday’s close and its stock is up 7%. The 5y CDS is now back to 100bp, 16th widest CDXIG name, vs 7th earlier this week. That price action is common to Colorado oil drillers and came after 57% of Colorado’s voters rejected the so-called ‘Prop 112’ plan to limit drilling there. If it had gone through, it would have forced O&Gs; to relocate away from residential and environmentally sensitive zones (which ½ CO is). Last summer, CO overtook CA as the 5th largest US state producer, behind TX, ND, NM, and OK. 

Ironically enough, this outperformance comes at a time when crude prices are pressured down. Indeed, focus seems to have shifted quickly to growing stockpiles in the US, away from supply concerns (Iran and, to a lesser extent, LatAm). WTI is down more than 20% in just slightly more than a month, making this downward move the sharpest since 2014, the year OPEC (led by Saudis) decided to not cap production to defend its market share. At the peak of oil crisis, in early 2016, APC 5y CDS was trading in the 500bp area. 

"
"No Smoke Without Fire. Today British American Tobacco Plc (BATSLN) has widened by c25bp, taking its 5y CDS spread from c75bp to c100bp. At first sight it looks like a big move on such a tight name. It happened after a senior US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) official said the agency is looking at restricting menthol in cigarettes. The regulator hopes to hit youth smoking by banning/restricting flavors in cigarettes. BATSLN was impacted because it produces Newport, the best-selling brand of menthol cigarettes in the US. Menthol cigarettes represent approximately ¼ of BATSLN profit, making it the most vulnerable group to that potential regulatory move. That explains the +25bp on the CDS / -11% on the stock. The higher leverage (now ~3.7x) since the 2017 merger (with RAI – Reynolds American Inc) adds to valid reasons why investors are more cautious on the name, going forward. 

Elsewhere it was a reasonably active session despite the US being out on Veterans Day. A typical risk-off day which saw CDS indices widen, stocks fall, govies richen and the US dollar rise vs all other G10s.

"
"Back To Negative Basis For Good?. It looked like another day in the office when investors arrived this morning. Compared with previous sessions, the same themes were at play. The market as a whole was weak. The oil sector was under pressure because of the uninterrupted slide of crude – it was down another 4% today – and British financial institutions suffered from the usual mumbo-jumbo about Brexit negotiations, where “progress were being made” but “discussions were still ongoing” and a “deal was not there yet”. But towards the end of the afternoon, a number of news outlets reported that a “breakthrough in the Brexit negotiations” had been made triggering a bounce of the British Pound. European credit indices actually followed and tightened across the board as a wave of short covering hit the market. If UK banks felt some kind of relief and were indicated tighter, most other sectors proved stickier and a number of risk premia were left unchanged, opening the way for some arbitrages to be executed, where people were able to buy index protection and sell single reference CDS for a profit. iTraxx Main finished the day 23cts more expensive than its fair value. Its risk premium has not been that tight compared to its constituents since late 2016.
"
"Déjà Vu. It is not 2015 all over again, when oil went from $100 per barrel to $42, but the roughly 25% fall in oil price from $86 per barrel to $67 since the beginning of October has eventually caught credit investors’ attention. Worries over rising oil production around the world and weakening demand from developing countries has just driven a 12-day uninterrupted fall which just ended today. Stockpiles are building, and producers are struggling to agree on production cuts. According to experts, supply will likely outstrip demand by early next year due to a potential cooling of the global economy and slower growth in China, which is in the middle of a trade war with the United States. On both sides of the Atlantic, the risk premia of oil companies have been remarked wider. The weakest American credits like Weatherford International or Transocean Inc have been impacted the most (+ 700bps at 2,457bps and +127bps at 535bps respectively over the last week), but even European names which are traditionally much more stable have seen their credit risk re-assessed. During the past week, Repsol is 19bps wider at 80bps, BP is 17bps wider at 62bps, while Equinor ASA and Total are 11bps wider at 35bps and 39bps respectively.
"
"A good deal… of Brexit headlines. Brexit headlines dominated the wires today, especially after the official announcement of Dominic Raab’s resignation. € CDS indices went wider (Main +3.3 XOver +13.8) with UK names logically underperforming, Gilts rallied 13bp, GBP lost 2% vs most G10s. May’s speech in front of Parliament took them off the wides, as she said that the deal was still a ‘draft’ at this stage. In banks space, STANLNPLC and HSBCHD outperformed (+7/+10) the truly domestic UK banks, namely BACRPLC +17 RBSGRP +17 LLOY +18. Banks stocks also crashed, RBS lost 10% in LSE, as Corbyn considers breaking it up to create new local public banks, if he was to take power (an event whose probability has increased a good deal today). As far as UK retailers (~ +18) are concerned, underperformance was pushed further by the publication of much weaker-than-expected headline retail sales for October (-0.5% MoM vs +0.2% consensus). 2% later on GBP$, the consensus seems that the deal May has negotiated will not pass Parliament in its current state. 
"
"From Hero To Zero. The Japanese press dropped a bombshell on Renault-Nissan this morning, revealing that Carlos Ghosn had been arrested and was being heard by the Japanese justice on the ground of fiscal fraud. More importantly, the initial investigation appears to have come from Nissan itself. The company reported this morning that Mr Ghosn, chairman of Nissan but also chairman and CEO of Renault and chairman of Mitsubishi Motors had indeed under-reported his income over several years in the company’s securities reports and had made personal use of some company assets. The impact of Mr Ghosn’s arrest could be significant, as he still has a pivotal position into the alliance structure and concentrates the bulk of strategic decision making in his hands. The situation creates the risk of looser ties between the car-makers and notably more independence from the Japanese side to the detriment of Renault, whose industrial scale has been built on the synergies it extracts from the alliance. It could undermine the group’s long-term strategy at a time when the industry is focusing on challenges such as electric vehicles and autonomous driving. If one could argue that the 18bps move wider of Nissan’s risk premium to 55bps move was relatively bigger than Renault’s 27bps move wider at 150bps, investors seemed more preoccupied by the French constructor’s situation.
"
"UK Names Can Go Tighter. December is fast approaching and the window to issue debt will soon close for corporates which have financing requirements. VUECIN (Vue International) decided to make the most of the last few days left in the current window to announce the issue of 7-year-facility, consisting of two tranches, one in Euro amounting roughly to €600mln and one in GBP amounting to £300mln. The proceeds of this term loan will be used to finance the acquisition of Cinestar and its new site capital expenditures, but also to refinance existing debt. VUECIN’s existing senior secured floating rate notes in Euro and senior secured notes in sterling will be entirely taken out. That means that only loans will be deliverable into CDS contracts going forward. So even though the leverage is expected to remain flat at 5.5x, VUECIN’s CDS was one of the standout performers among iTraxx Crossover constituents today. It closed 56bps tighter at 296bps. With this money coming back to £ bond holders, it could provide some relief to GBP HY which has been bidless for more than a week.
"
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. It was a quiet session in € CDS space ($4.3B of Main), because of Thanks Giving. Financials were the most active sector, especially UK, Italians and Deutsche Bank. 
• UK financials outperformed (-5/-7). We were -10/-12 at some point in early AM, including on tight names such as AVLN (5y CDS is 83bp). That felt fast, on the back of headlines stating that UK/EU determined to replace the backstop. We reverted as soon as the EU reportedly said Brexit issues of Ireland and Gibraltar remain.
• Italian banks are wider (+1/+2) on the day, although BTPs bull steepened and 10y BTP/Bund spread tightened -4. Slight underperformance here. 1/ BTP Italia order book was said to close at just €1.3B. That was the 2nd lowest for a BTP Italia issuance since the €0.8B in 2012, well short of the highest (€10.5B in 2014). 2/ The EC informally recommended a debt-based EDP, with a formal launch expected in JAN by Eurogroup and EU Council. That has the potential to keep Italy under pressure to tighten fiscal. The risk I see on the political side is more anti-EU sentiment… EDP may request budgetary adjustments within 3-6M, without which Italy would get sanctions (0.2%- 0.5% GDP). 3/ Di Maio said that he sees room for dialogue with the EU and that 2019 deficit won’t breach 2.4% GDP. Interestingly, market reaction to Di Maio’s comments has been eroding lately, with local media regularly reporting increasing pressures from Lega to change budget (incl. Savona). There is a general sense that Lega is gradually taking over Five Star Movement. Last poll (Noto) gives Lega 33% 5SM 25%, vs 17%/33% back in the last general election in March. 
• Deutsche Bank (‘DB’ / Snr +10 Sub +20) was the worst performer in iTraxx Main, iTraxx Senior Fin and iTraxx Sub Fin. The 5y senior CDS is back at the widest level since the end of 2016. The main reason today was CitiBank CEO saying a combination with DB didn’t make sense, because the overlap was too big. DB also reportedly lost money on some equity ‘risk mgt trades’ ($60M loss this year, not much for DB credit, but enough to remember that their equity trading revenue has fallen 13 quarters in a row). DB had widened earlier this week amid reports that it was the unnamed ""major European bank"" that helped process c$150B in payments linked to Danske Bank's money-laundering scandal.

"
"Oil Is Well That Ends Well?. Crude oil prices collapsed today again, on signs of record Saudi output, high inventories across the globe, risks of China’s economy slowing down, Iran effectively able to export thanks to waivers, and weaker risk sentiment. WTI lost almost 8% on the day, and around 34% since the October 3rd peak. Brent followed south $60/bbl. for the first time in a year. As a consequence, US IG energy companies (exploration & production, refiners, marketers, drillers) are underperforming today, their 5y CDS widening by 7/10bp. While Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members reportedly plan quiet output cuts to avoid Trump's ire, Russia doesn’t seem in a rush to join this move. Listening to Trump’s recent speeches, it is clear that he considers the c35% lower gasoline prices in the US a key achievement. Therefore he may well continue to pressure Saudis to not cut output, ahead of the OPEC meeting scheduled on Dec 6th in Vienna. Coincidentally, Trump has recently declared that he would support the Saudis despite his own intelligence agency concluded that Saudi crown prince MBS ordered Khashoggi’s murder. 
"
"Not Going According To (Donald's) Plan…. GM ( General Motors Company ) announced today that they will cut more than 10,000 salaried staff and factory workers, while closing seven factories worldwide by the end of next year. This is part of a sweeping plan to prepare for a future of electric and self-driving vehicles. The structural changes are also meant to pivot towards producing SUVs and crossovers as customers’ preferences change, while abandoning some of the slower selling sedan models.  If the company and its unions do not come up with an agreement to allocate more work to factories in North America, it could mean the closing down of four facilities in the United States and one in Canada. The planned job reductions, which come on the heels of surprisingly strong third quarter results, triggered some harsh comments from unions’ representatives that merely see the move as an attempt to close American plants and shift production abroad. It will surely not go down very well with the White House either, but the market did not seem too bothered. GM’s risk premium was marked 14bps tighter at 181bps, making it the best performer among the CDX IG constituents today.
"
"Let s Decompress. The European High Yield market was a war zone today, with 3 of iTraxx Crossover (ITXEX) constituents among the casualties. Bonds of PIZEXP (Pizza Express), TCGLN (Thomas Cook Group Plc), and WINDTRE (Wind Tre Spa) got hammered and closed 8pts, 4pts and 3pts lower. These names make up enough of High Yield indices to affect most investors and they unsurprisingly dominated the flows. This single B compartment is proving increasingly painful for long only investors. According to many market participants, the three names mentioned had already an element of bad news priced in and had sold off more than the market in recent sessions in anticipation of bad numbers. However, on the actual events – they all reported weak earnings this morning -, they sold off even further. It pushed the recent decompression even further. While iTraxx Main (ITXEB) closed 1bp wider at 80bps today, ITXEX closed 9bps wider at 339bps. Over the last week ITXEX is 12bps wider while ITXEB is 0.5bps tighter, and over the last month ITXEX is 36bps basis wider while ITXEB is 3bps wider. All these relative moves compare with the widely accepted 1 to 4 ratio.
"
"And Another. The day started with little trading activity and with a reasonably strong tone to it. Clients were not really keen on buying protection and dealers’ appetite to sell risk appeared to have been satiated during previous sessions. On the flip side, there was little risk addition either and gradually the sentiment changed. It was not helped by another name blowing up in the European High Yield space. NVFVES (Novafives), the French engineering group, reported weak third quarter results and covenant net leverage at 5.8 times up from 4.8 in the second quarter. In their outlook, the management said they expect the logistics division to keep growing fast, but Ebitda margin guidance for 2018 was revised down to 5% with full year sales maintained at €2Bln. The company’s bonds got punished and were indicated approximately 6pts lower on the day. Bearing in mind that these bonds had already lost something like 10pts ahead of the numbers since mid-November, it shows once again how traitorous the High Yield market is at the moment.
"
"Black Friday, Yellow Vests, Red Retailers. Auchan Holding (AUCHAN) widened +20bp as “Yellow Vest” protests led to an aggregate -18% fall in consumer goods sales at main French retailers last Saturday (Black Friday weekend) compared to the average of Saturdays since the beginning of September. It had fallen -35% the previous Saturday. Number of shops were shut, some others were open but the access to it was blocked by the demonstrations and some others were short of supply because of disruption at depots. AUCHAN was thus the worst performing name in the iTraxx Main s30, clearly wider than the second worst retailer Carrefour (CAFP) +5bp. This was the biggest move in more than 2 months on CAFP CDS, as this name tends to be quite low beta. Its shares also dropped -2.0%, while the CAC Index was up +0.5%. November will prove very challenging for French consumer spending, compared to October. Indeed, October data out this morning surprised on the upside (0.8% MoM vs 0.6% MoM exp). Yellow Vests could have an impact on the French economy if those last, as December is a key month, given the Christmas shopping period. 
"
"Have We Gone Too Far ?. The expectations for the G-20 summit held over the week-end were muted, with a balance of risk tilted to the downside. After “highly successful” discussions - according to the Americans -, the US agreed to delay for 90 days the implementation of additional tariffs on $200bln of imports from China. In return, China promised to use the time to make progress on relaxing non-tariff barrier, fighting intellectual property theft and reducing bilateral trade surplus. The credit market reacted positively, and indices traded aggressively tighter across the board during the first exchanges. But as the morning wore on, profit takers emerged and in the afternoon most of the business consisted in clients derisking their portfolio. Volumes were light on cash products, which is usually not a very positive sign regarding the strength of the rally. Nevertheless, credit indices managed to close tighter across all geographies and all rating classes. That might be enough to give some investors the nerves to attempt a long risk bet, during a week that will be shortened on some products which will not trade on Wednesday in tribute to the late George Bush. 
"
"A Trip To Hell. After a heatwave in the UK led many Britons to holiday at home and was blamed for a slump in sales which saw prices for late bookings tumble, TCGLN ( Thomas Cook Group Plc ) have seen earnings plunge. In the past three months, the company has issued three profit warnings and investors have been dumping the stock aggressively, also encouraged by rumours of a possible capital increase. The stock has been roughly halved over the last fortnight – impressive even if it pales in comparison to November 2011 when the stock lost 75% in a day -, but concerns are not limited to the equity market. Bonds are also feeling the heat. Both the 6.25% 2022 and the 3.875% 2023, which were issued 1 and 2 years ago respectively are roughly trading at 70cts on the dollar, while both were trading above par in the summer. It looks as if investors have lost confidence in the ability of the management to turn the business around and produce a sustainable business plan. The credit market estimates that the future of TCGLN is seriously in doubt. At 24% upfront, 5-year CDS referencing the company’s debt put its default probability at two third by the end of 2023.
"
"Lost For Direction. Today’s session was weak and driven by macro news. Risky assets were indicated lower at the end of the Asian session following the arrest of a senior executive of Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei, which is suspected of trying to evade US trade curbs on Iran. That led to a very cautious open. Rumours that the vote on the Brexit deal due in the UK Parliament on Tuesday would be postponed only added to uncertainty. Effectively, faced with the possibility of an embarrassing defeat of her Brexit deal, Mrs May announced in the afternoon to the House of Commons she would defer the vote and return to Brussels to seek “assurances” from European leaders. The words of the embattled UK Prime Minister signalled she does not expect much of the substance will be changed though, and she failed to reassure on the probability of seeing a deal going through as it raises the prospect that she will be back in January with virtually the same deal. So much uncertainty is leaving many credit investors on the side-lines. Increasingly illiquid and jittery, the credit market appears to be in follow rather lead at the moment, and it looks likely that it will go up and down looking at the S&P; in the coming days and weeks.
"
"Trade Talks Optimism. It was a seasonably quiet session in terms of volumes, as Christmas liquidity is gradually setting in. The current level of uncertainty regarding political developments across the globe is not giving investors any incentive to add inconsiderate amount of risks. It has recently translated into exacerbated intraday volatility. Today, while indices reacted positively on hopes of renewed trade talks between the US and China after a statement saying Chinese Vice Premier Liu He discussed a timetable with US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin by phone, the risk premia of single reference entities largely underperformed as names remain sticky to recent trading levels. Trade talk optimism benefitted one group though. Metal and Miners have been put under pressure since the beginning of October. The risk premia of GLENLN ( Glencore Plc ), MTNA ( ArcelorMittal SA ), and AALLN ( Anglo American Plc ) all rebounded off the recent wides they reached earlier in the month and closed 9bps tighter at 203bps, 210bps and 166bps respectively, which made Basic Material the best performing sector on the day among iTraxx Main constituents. Changing the time horizon – that can be achieved by clicking on the different time spans in the top left corner of the above grapple – will paint you a very different picture over the last week or the last month.
"
"Are There More To Follow?. SRAC (Sears) has been the first name to default in series 31 of CDX HY on October 15th, even though the auction that will help determine the payout of CDS contracts has still not been held. The second default happened overnight, as PKD ( Parker Drilling Company ) voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 protection under an agreement with a group of debtors that will allow it to quickly restructure. Drilling contractors have struggled to recover from a steep drop in oil prices which reached a trough in 2016. The recent step-down in crude levels – Brent lost roughly 30% since early October to close at $60/barrel tonight – threatens to derail a long-predicted recovery for off-shore companies, which typically handle more expensive projects that require higher energy prices to turn a profit. As recently as November, PKD warned its investors it might not be able to repay certain debts. Since then, its obligations have been trading at levels implying a near certain default and today’s announcement did not come as a big surprise to investors. The question is rather whether PKD is only the first shoe to drop and whether they should expect more decompression between the energy heavy CDX HY and other credit indices.
"
"Falling Knife Catching: The -16% rule. General Electric Company (GE) was the big mover (again) today. The 5y CDS is 23bp tighter, making the name the best performer in the CDX IG, and by far (other single names are -6/+6). Cash is also c25bp tighter and the stock was is +7%, as I write. 

This rather bullish move comes mainly after 2 developments: 
1/ the upgrade by the J.P. Morgan analyst.
2/ some early news of the sale of the ServiceMax stake. 

On the former, it is worth noting that the J.P. Morgan analyst now has for GE a price target of $6. Implying a drop from here of... -16%. 

A quick look in the rear-view mirror shows that since Nov 12, GE 5y CDS is unchanged. Over the same period, GE stock is... -16%. 

Elsewhere it was a rather firm day with CDS indices slightly tighter (Main -1 CDX IG -1). Noteworthy that volumes and liquidity were low, as we approach the end of the year.
"
"Is Trend Your Friend In 2019?. It might be. But, for the time being, liquidity is not. Argentine Republic (ARGENT) CDS was the worst performer in CDX EM today, wider +30bp, while other LatAm sovereigns are broadly unchanged (-2/0). Volumes were low, and liquidity was poor. Cash opened from ~1p (23s) to ~1.5p (27s) lower. That coincided with DXY testing year high (after weak Chinese data, weak € PMIs, Brexit, risk sentiment deterioration). Later, ARGENT bounced back on no news, paring around half the move as $ fell off the highs, post disappointing US December PMIs. 

No doubt that low liquidity amplified today’s move, nevertheless ARGENT spread has been trending upwardly over the past 6 weeks. Tighter FCs, $ strength, unresolved trade tensions, and at the 2nd order (via trade partners) commodities volatility, are potential headwinds for ARGENT next year. But the main 2019 risk may be a failed re-election bid by the current President Macri, as this could disrupt economic policy continuity. A quick look in the rear-view mirror reminds us that, in a sense, we have been in a sweet spot.

"
"From Bad To Worse. Asos Plc is the UK’s largest online-only fashion retailer. It aims at a client base aged between 20-30 years, and offers branded and own label products across womenswear and menswear. Today, its shares plunged the most in more than 4 years after it cut its sales outlook. The company said its sales growth in the year ending in August will be about 15%, down from an earlier guidance of 20 to 25%. More specifically, November was “significantly behind expectations”. It pointed to the backdrop of economic uncertainty across major markets, together with a weakening in consumer confidence. These comments echoed statements made last week by Sports Direct CEO Mike Ashley who told analysts while discussing first half results that November was “unbelievably bad” for the sector. He added that “retailers can’t take that kind of November, it will literally smash them to pieces”. Needless to say that investors were quick to extrapolate what the consequences might be for NXTLN ( Next Plc ) and MARSPE ( Marks and Spencer Group Plc ). These two names were the worst performers in the European investment grade universe by a fair margin. Their risk premia widened by 23bps and 19bps to 163bps and 219bps respectively.
"
"Within Touching distance Of 2016’s Lows. Asian markets were on the back foot overnight after anxieties about economic growth swirled, when Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared to push back against US president Donald Trump in a speech he delivered in Beijin. A US government report published yesterday forecast a large increase of shale-oil production. Although Russia is supposed to be preparing to implement output curbs to comply with cuts agreed to by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said oil production is rising. The combination of fear about recession and scepticism about the ability of oil producers to coordinate in order to decrease the amount they pump is always a losing proposition for crude prices. They got battered today – Brent and WTI traded below $58 and $48 per barrel respectively – and reached their lowest level in more than a year. The group which has been identified by our clustering algorithm as “US Energy” and effectively regroups investment grade and high yield energy companies alike was the worst performer on the day by a fair margin.
"
"Happy EMd. Ahead of what market participants expect to be a dovish FOMC, we have seen risk rallying across asset classes and the dollar soften. Apart from ITALY (-12), which owns its tightening move to the finding of a compromise between Rome and Brussels, EM sovereign CDS have benefitted from a softer US dollar and the consolidation of US rates at a lower level. Indeed 10y US Treasuries have rallied c45bp since the local peak reached on Oct 9. The short end rally was also arguably impressive: we came from pricing 4.1 hikes to December 2019 FOMC (including today’s) to 1.4, this AM. Putting this differently, assuming a hike today, longs need to see no hike over 2019 to finish in the green. Although this looks like a big move, it has been welcomed by EM risk, decently strong today, led by middle East names. Indeed LEBAN (-40) and TURKEY (-16) are the best performers in CDX EM, as Trump ordered a full US troop withdrawal from Syria (yes, he meant Syria, not Irak). 
"
"Santa Rally?. The Fed has ‘disappointed’ risky assets, despite efforts by Jay Powell to sound dovish and the lower median dot from 3 to 2. No change on balance sheet normalisation was mentioned. Credit widening gathered momentum as NY came in today, closing the day +6 on Main and +8 on CDX IG. Along with other risky assets, crude oil fell abruptly (-4.5%), leading drillers and other energy-related names wider by 10-15bp, across the US and Canada. MO (+30) widened the most. The 5y CDS now pays 100 while it was in mid 30s about two months ago. The main cause here seems to be the $12.8B investment for the Juul minority stake. Indeed, this implies a relatively high valuation of Juul at $38B. Despite stocks being in oversold territory (the most since GFC and Dot Com), the fact that the market prices in just 0.4 hike for next year while the year communicates on 2 can be perceived as bearish. Another potential option for the Fed to ease panic would be to alter the normalisation path of its balance sheet.

"It’s All In Their Head. Welcome to 2019! Let’s first use the opportunity of this blog to wish all our (regular and accidental) readers a very Happy New Year. As far as credit markets are concerned, 2019 begun very much like 2018 ended, with every index trading at very expensive levels compared to their fair values. The apparent bid for single name protection is mainly coming from the anticipation of a heavy issuance pipeline. Indeed, when new deals reach the market, they do so at hefty discounts compared to existing bonds. Today, INTNEDGRP ( ING Groep NV ) issued a €1Bln 7-year bond which was roughly 25bps cheaper than existing notes. It repriced the whole complex and sent INTNEDGRP’s 5-year risk premium 9bps wider at 115bps and the bid for CDS was deep. But when there is no substance behind that new issue fear, it is effectively proving very difficult to sell protection on most of the names and the very negative bases that seem to exist between credit indices and their constituents are a pure fiction. Over the last few sessions, arbitrageurs have repeatedly tried to capture the 38cts up for grab on iTraxx Main but miserably failed each time by a fair margin.
"
"The Price Of Being First. The busiest sector in Europe was TMT. Once again, this flurry of activity was a consequence of bond issuance, which is the overriding theme since the beginning of the year. TITIM ( Telecom Italia SpA ) sold the first bond of the year in the European high-yield market. It brought a €1.25Bln 5-year transaction and set the terms for it to be a success, offering a 0.7% yield concession to existing bonds with a similar maturity. It was justified as the company was the first to test investors’ appetite in what is still a volatile market. The discount offered a decent entry point to credit investors who so far had been wary of the ongoing battle between the company’s main shareholders and who realised last year after the scrapping of its debt reduction target by TITIM that it was not about to bounce back to an investment grade rating. The newly issued bonds traded well and ended the day wrapped around par, while they were issued at 99.436, but it pushed TITIM’s 5-year CDS 20bps wider at 330bps.

"Everybody Joins The Party. Retail has been one of the best performing sectors over the first few sessions of the year. Today, UK retailers led the charge. Market researchers Nielsen and Kantar Worldpanel released data that showed consumer spending over the key Christmas period has been more robust than expected in the UK. Most of these companies will give analysts sales update in the coming days, but investors did not bother to wait, nor did they seem to care about the vote on Brexit due in Parliament next Tuesday. They sent the risk premia of the whole group much tighter. TSCOLN ( Tesco Plc ), Britain’s largest supermarket, outperformed its peers and was only second to Asda among the big four which also include SBRY ( J Sainsbury Plc ) and Morrisons. It was crowned best performer of the day. Its 5-yeard CDS closed 19bps tighter at 137bps, while MARSPE’s ( Marks and Spencer Group Plc ) was 12bps tighter at 215bps. Even SBRY which missed analysts’ estimates in the morning joined the party and was 8bps tighter at 142bps.

"Santa Claus Is A Stinker. Retailers notably underperformed US IG CDS in today’s session. Macy’s Inc (FD) CDS widened c40bp after they cut their annual profit and sales forecasts, announcing that sales slowed in the key pre-Christmas period of mid-December. EPS expected range was downwardly revised to $3.95-4.00 per share, vs previously $4.10-4.30. In parallel, A one-off development was a fire in its West Virginia distribution centre. But beyond that, underperformance in sectors such as fashion and jewellery point to bad Christmas sales. In the same sector, FD’s peer Kohl’s Corp (KSS) widened 13bp, after its holiday sales growth of 1.2% disappointed. The latter has to be compared with a c7% comp sales growth last year. The Christmas period seems to have been a tough test for the retail sector, as online shops makes competition fierce.
"
"More Horsepower Under The Hood. General Motors (GM) CDS has gone tighter by 15bp on surprise earnings forecasts. That move makes the CDS tighter c50bp since Jan 3 peak. Cash was also 10-15bp tighter, and stocks jumped up to 9%, which was about half their ’18 loss. That follows the cost cuts announced in November. According to the CFO, those cuts should boost ‘19 earnings by $2.0-2.5B and ’20 earnings by another $3-3.5B. This development came as a surprise in a challenging context for the auto industry. The sector was one of the favourite shorts of late 2018. Despite the volatility on the name, ICE-reported open interest has been relatively stable in late ’18 / early ’19, at around $2B. In parallel, Ford Co (F) spreads improved by c6bp following yesterday’s c15bp rally after the news they would cut their European staff. Elsewhere, US IG credit was globally little moved. Based on London close, US IG single names are ranging -5/+3 while the CDX IG index is flat. 
"
"As Good As Gone. NEWLOK’s (New Look Senior Issuer Plc) bonds fell roughly 15pts after the U.K. apparel chain said it had reached an agreement with its bond holders to restructure the £1.5Bln its owes its creditors. They will forfeit their claims in return for new bonds and a majority stake of the restructured business. The current owners, private equity group Brait SE, will hold 30% of the company once the transaction goes through. Eventually, NEWLOK will have £350mln in long term debt and a £150mln in new bonds which will be issued. After the operation, the company’s debt will pay 12% in annual interests which will be partly payable in kind (NEWLOK will have the possibility to skip cash payments by adding more debt to the principal amount). Investors were not expecting the restructuration of the debt to happen that soon, but the retailer cited weak business conditions over the Christmas as the catalyst after it was left with less cash than expected to service its debt. The probability of default over the next 5 years was already very close to 100%. Today’s price action on NEWLOK’s CDS pushed the 1-year probability at 79%. Nobody is betting on the company seeing another Christmas in its current form.

"Are They Listening?. Banks kickstarted the US earning season. Today was JPM’s ( JPMorgan Chase & Co ) turn. During a call with analysts, Jamie Dimon, the CEO, warned that a prolonged government shutdown could completely stop economic growth in the US. That part did not really register with market participants who sent all risky assets roaring higher – credit was no exception with iTraxx Main and CDX IG both closing 1bp tighter -. Rather, they first focused on a rare miss in earnings - $1.98 per share against the $2.20 people were expecting – which were dragged down by a 16% decrease in bond trading to roughly $1.8Bln, the lowest since the financial crisis. It came right after C ( Citigroup Inc ) reported yesterday a steep decline in fixed income trading as the Fed raised rates and volatility spooked credit investors, which could be a worry for banks that rely more heavily on their investment banking division. It weighted on JPM’s risk premium that was indicated a few bps wider, but it was eventually caught by the general sentiment and finished 2bps tighter at 68bps. That said, since early October, it has almost doubled, and the widening trajectory has not been interrupted yet.

"Can Two Weaks Make A Strong?. A few months ago, German officials said that they would view favourably a tie-up between DB (Deutsche Bank AG) and CMZB ( Commerzbank AG), as the idea of a banking national champion appealed to them. But today, the European Central Bank said that it favours cross-border combinations to drive integration in the region’s financial markets. An analysis by BaFin, the German regulator, suggested a preference for European deals because the two domestic banks are currently too weak to benefit sufficiently from a merger. That analysis seems in line with what DB’s management think. Indeed, towards the end of last year, they apparently came to the conclusion that a merger with UBSGRP ( UBS Group AG ) would be the most favourable option, but that the timing was not right given the German bank’s share price. Investors expressed relief at the thought the two ailing institutions could not merge after all and find more robust partners instead. DB’s 5-year risk premium closed 12bps tighter at 189bps and CMZB’s closed 8bps tighter at 112bps.

"So Long As It Is Black…. Ford Co (F) 5y CDS widened c20bp on the day, making it the worst performing name in CDX IG index. F presented worse than expected 2018 results at the global auto conference in Detroit yesterday. Preliminary 2018 EPS is $1.30, vs previous range of $1.30-$1.50, and vs consensus of $1.32. This 2018 weakness was mainly due to difficulties in China, Europe, and LatAm, partly caused by tariffs and higher raw material prices. 2019 outlook is more upbeat. But black swans remain, including cost cutting execution risks and a recovery in China/Europe which may not happen so soon. Adding to that, F also stated that a no-deal Brexit would be very negative for them, and for the industry. Nevertheless, F reaffirmed long-term targets of >8% EBIT margin and <2.5x leverage ratio. Its core market, North America, seems to be closest to target, with a 7.9% Adj EBIT margin vs 8% target. F also remains committed to its IG ratings (F is BBB/BBB at S&P; Fitch) but Moody’s remains the weak link (Baa3 neg since last summer).

"The Best Of Both Worlds. Today was a strong day for risk, CDS indices are tighter (iTraxx Main -2.5 CDX IG -3) and stocks are higher (SX5E +2% SPX +1.5%). Risk seems to be enjoying the best of both worlds, with both positive news on the trade side of the equation and more accommodative central banks, on the monetary side. Adding to it, on the technical side, CTAs have kept adding risk. But there are a few caveats in this rosy picture. Positive trade headlines have been denied or strongly mitigated, with little reaction market reaction. Thursday headline *U.S. WEIGHS ROLLING BACK CHINA TARIFFS TO CALM MARKETS: WSJ was later met with *TREASURY DENIES REPORT MNUCHIN PUSHED TO LOWER CHINA TARIFFS. Moreover, the headline mentions Mnuchin, who is arguably on the dovish side of the equation. It would be interesting to see, not only if this is confirmed, but also whether that opinion is shared by Lightizer, who is more on the hawkish side. Friday headline *CHINA IS SAID TO OFFER PATH TO ELIMINATE U.S. TRADE IMBALANCE was followed by *U.S. TRADE NEGOTIATORS SAID TO BE SKEPTICAL OF CHINA’S OFFER. This is not the first time China tries this path to break the deadlock on trade, but in the past, it has been met with little enthusiasm from the US side. It is legitimate to wonder how high is the hurdle for the Fed to reprice, and it is worth noting that $ 1y1y OIS has moved from below 210bp to 240bp in two weeks. 
"
"Back From The Dead. Whilst the US holiday today meant a quiet start to the week in credit volume wise, there was some news in Europe to digest for the market. Ziggo, which provides telecommunications and media services throughout the Netherlands, had in the past used a SPV named Ziggo Bond Finance NV (ZBF) to issue debt. In its annual account 2017 filed in December 2018, ZBF mentioned that “the VodafoneZiggo SPV structure was terminated on March 8, 2018” leading some market participants to assume the market had missed a succession event as the lookback period during which investors much identify a structural change spans 90 days. The value of protection referencing ZBF debt collapsed from 300bps to 150bps as they assumed it was now an dead box. It looks as if they got carried away though. Indeed, in the revamped CDS documentation published in 2014, the notion of “Universal Successor” was introduced. As long as an entity assumes all of the obligations of a reference entity, it is deemed its Successor, regardless of the backstop date. In the same 2017 annual account, it was also said that Ziggo Bondco assumed all the obligations under the note issued by ZBF. The Determination Committee of ISDA confirmed today that CDS formerly referencing ZBF are now in effect referencing Ziggo Bondco, and protect exactly the same debt as before. Unsurprisingly, these CDS were pushed 86bps wider to 253bps.

"Nice Timing. Last Friday, TITIM ( Telecom Italia SpA ) issued a profit warning. They announced that organic EBITDA of its domestic business unit is expected to be lower than last year. Overall, including TIM’s brasil performance, consolidated organic EBITDA is expected to be about €8.1Bln. Adjusted consolidated net financial debt is expected to be about €25.2Bln. If the debt number was globally in line with expectations, the preliminary EBITDA disappointed. TTIM’s press release also suggested that this measure would remain under substantial pressure at least throughout the first semester, and that the cost of protecting the investor base in Italy comes at a high cost. There are also question marks regarding the strategy of the struggling former monopoly which has still not decided on a plan for its landline network, its most valuable asset. Its proposal to legally separate the network from the rest of the company in order to set-up the business for potential deals was rejected by Italy’s communications regulator over the week-end. TITIM’s stock got crushed (it was suspended at some point during the day to stop the rout) and ended the session down roughly 6%. The price action in credit was not different, and TITIM’s 5-year risk premium widened 19bps to 348bps, its widest level in more than 6 years. The bonds the company issued a couple of weeks ago at 99.436 were trading at 98.88. Nice timing.

"When In Doubt, Wear Red. Despite President Draghi wearing a red tie today at the ECB press conference, he failed to sound hawkish. But more importantly he also failed to mention any potential discussion around an extension of the TLTROs for Eurozone banks (neither in statement nor presser), something that some strategists/market participants had expected/hoped for. As a result, this session saw a choppy price action in the financial space, with iTraxx Senior Financial index trading in a 5.5bp wide range, vs just 2.5bp for iTraxx Main. In particular, the ECB presser saw the index revert from tighter -4bp on the day to +1bp, finally closing in at -1bp. DB has been clearly outperforming throughout the session (-10bp intraday, closed -5bp and -40bp over the past 2 months) on renewed headlines this morning, in the sense of a potential merger with CMZB.  FAZ reported that the German government (MOF Scholz and deputy MOF Kukies) has reportedly been in talks with Cerberus (has stakes in both DB and CMZB). Kukies sounds favourable to such a merger, as he sees an urgent need to build a strong lender in Germany before the next downturn. That is not clear yet how a combination of two troubled lenders would make a stronger one, which is why the regulator (BaFin) does not sound favourable to this merger yet. 
"
"Sitting On A Gold Mine. In a fairly risk-on session, European CDS tightened, led by high-betas, among which metal & mining companies. GLENLN (-9bp), MTNA (-12bp) and AALLN (-7bp) outperformed both the iTraxx Main (-2bp) and its fair value (-2.6bp). That relative outperformance is not only due to high beta. Solid production results at AALLN, RIO and BHP have boosted sentiment towards the sector. A general bullish price action in metals space helped too. Both base (+0.5%/+3.0%) and precious metals (+1.5%/+3.0%) have been boiled by a weaker dollar (DXY -0.7%). This reflects a broad optimism ahead of next week’s US-China discussions (Jan 30-31) and FOMC meeting (Jan 29-30) where officials might discuss bringing forward the end of the balance sheet unwind (WSJ). An effective de-escalation in trade tensions, coupled with a more dovish Fed and Chinese stimulus are supportive of the sector. But, the medium-term outlook might not be that clear. Miners’ performance remains closely tied to global growth, especially EM growth, as those countries are the biggest consumers of metals (China). That said, if a global recession was to happen in 2020, companies over-weighting precious metals over industrial ones would probably outperform the sector, as gold prices would probably rise. Today ABX 5y CDS is tighter -2bp, close to the tightest level in a decade, in mid 70s. Appetite for M&A;, reputational risk and transparency issues are other risks chronically on the cards, in the sector.

"The Earning Circus Is Back In Town. We already had a trickle of results in the past few weeks, but the reporting season is about to gather steam. Over the next few weeks, all major companies will be releasing fourth numbers on both sides of the Atlantic. Today some heavyweights entered the fray. CAT ( Caterpillar Inc ) was among them and they did it in style by announcing their biggest quarterly profit miss over the last 10 years. The construction and mining equipment maker, widely considered a bellwether for the global industrial economy, reported a fourth-quarter profit that trailed analysts’ average estimate of $2.99 by 44cts at $2.55 per share and offered a cautious outlook for 2019. The company blamed slowing global growth and concerns around the US-China trade war. Its shares sunk roughly 10% and the cost of insuring its debt for 5 years jumped 7bps to 55bps per year. That is the kind of moves we usually only see on CAT around roll dates, when the maturity of 5-year CDS contracts is in fact extended by 6 months. 
"
"No More Than A Knee-Jerk Reaction. TACHEM ( Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd ) entered the Japanese credit index benchmark (aka iTraxx Japan) last September. Since then, its risk premium has embarked on a fairly bumpy ride as the company announced towards the end of 2018 that it was taking over UK-based pharmaceutical Shire for $62Bln, in one of the largest deals of the year. The deal which closed early January propelled it among the 10 biggest drug makers by sales, but also more than doubled the Japanese firm’s borrowing levels. The management massaged credit investors and said they intend to move quickly on asset sales as part of a deleveraging plan. They laid out a scenario for $10Bln of potential divestments and stressed the importance of maintaining an investment grade rating, after both Moody’s and S&P; lowered the company’s rating over the last few weeks. They did a decent job, and TACHEM’s 5-year risk premium that peaked at 100bps in December closed at 62bps last Friday. But yesterday, TACHEM was rumoured to plan the sale of as much as 500Bln yen (€4Bln) of hybrid notes as early as April to extend its debt maturities. There was a knee-jerk reaction that sent the 5-year CDS at 74bps, but today normal service resume and it closed at 63bps, only a few bps away from last fall’s tightest levels. 
"
"A Tax Break Is Not Enough. The market was fairly confident going into the FOMC meeting, and risk enjoyed a positive session across the board. There were a few outliers and things did not pan out very well for PEMEX’s (Petroleos Mexicanos) credit investors. The company has seen oil output decline every year since 2004 and is Latin America’s most indebted borrower. It loses money on its inefficient refining business and because of endemic fuel theft – the company reports as many as 41 illegal pipeline taps every day -, which led to the tragedy that killed more than 100 people 10 days ago. Yesterday night Fitch downgraded Mexico’s oil producer to one notch above junk despite the government proposed  $3.5Bln cut from its taxes. The downgrade to BBB- reflects the “continued deterioration of PEMEX’s standalone credit profile” and the “under-investment in the company’s upstream business” according to Fitch. They added that the company had been technically insolvent since 2009 by having a negative total equity balance. PEMEX’s 5-year risk premium jumped 29bps to 315bps, off the 270bps tights reached a couple of days ago.

"Spreads Down, Fed Up. Today was a fully risk-on session that saw credit spreads tighten across the board. The iTraxx Main s30 index tightened by -3.5bp, while its US counterpart the CDX IG s31 tightened by -5.2bp. This aggressive move comes after a surprisingly dovish step taken by the Fed last night. Firstly the removal of “some further gradual hikes” in the forward guidance, and secondly the restating that the balance sheet size/composition was another tool to adjust policy, were dovish/unexpected. Powell repeated that future policy would be data dependent. Banks economists expect the US economy to grow 2-3% this year. The $ was better offered on the moment but remains strong vs € in particular, and the 1y1y $ OIS, which has retraced from ~205 (Jan 3) to ~240 (Jan 18), is now already back to ~220. 

In single-name CDS space, however, one name saw a contrarian price action on the day. KPN (Koninklijke KPN N.V.) widened 60bp, more than doubling its 5y CDS spread, on news that Canada’s biggest AM weighs bidding for it. Bad news for credit, potentially, but in the short term a good news for the stock, that is up 6.5% on the day. Decent price action, although the discussion is reportedly only at an early stage. This came a few hours after KPN reported for Q418. Overall a decent set of results with strategy reiterated, but leverage is already on an upward trend (net debt/ebitda came from 1.5x to 2.7x in one year). 

"
"January In Japan. January was a rather strong month for risky assets globally. It was a strong month for Japanese risk in particular, with iTraxx Japan s30 tighter c20bp Nikkei up 4% (6% from Jan 4 close). In this move tighter, sector performance was mixed. Marine transportation (3 names) tightened c60bp and Telecoms (2 names) tightened c40bp while other sectors tightened more marginally. In particular, Food, Construction and Transports are the lowest beta, tightening a small c10bp on average. Marine Transportation is the highest beta and happens to be the most leveraged sector. Indeed KAWKIS/MITSOL/NIPYU have ND/EBITDA ratios of 6.2/8.4/7.6 while the constructor SHIMIZ has just 1.1. But what is more worrying for Marine Transportation is its sluggish profitability. Transport and construction cos have positive double-digit ROEs. But KAWKIS/MITSOL/NIPYU have ROEs of 4.8%/-9.3%/3.7% respectively. Moreover, US/China potentially continued trade tensions and the risk of slower global growth will likely remain ongoing risks for the Marine Transportation sector, in the next few months. 
"
"Who Does Not Love A Late Twist?. SUNCOM (Sunrise Communications) and Liberty Global have been holding on-off talks about merging their Swiss businesses for a while. Liberty’s management recently said that good progress were being made and that a turnaround of their swiss unit UPC was expected this year. That is probably one of the reasons analysts were assuming that an acquisition of Sunrise could create a scaled challenger and would make strategic sense but would not happen before 2020. To their surprise, an article published today suggested there could be a twist and that rather than offering an exit to SUNCOM’s shareholders, the saga could end with SUNCOM bidding for its domestic rival UPC. The rumours got a lukewarm reaction from the equity market – Sunrise’s stock lost 1.25% today – and sent SUNCOM’s 5-year risk premium through the roof – 75bps wider at 128bps - as investors were left considering the prospects of a company saddled with a dividend-sapping high leverage.

"February Brings The Rain. Not just in London, actually. The BTP market has been under some pressure over the past few sessions. Today the 10y BTP/Bund spread reached 270bp again. As that spread widened c30bp, the 5y sovereign CDS widened by c15bp. That comes even as today’s 30y syndication sounded successful. €8B sold vs €41B of bids. It seems like a strong bid-to-cover. It seems that many people have a clear idea how Italy will be like in 2049. Are these people non-resident (read: non-sticky ratings-driven investors)? May well be. Non-resident holdings had fallen to 30% in Q4 (a % seen last time in 1999). Then the strong foreign demand (64%) for the syndicated 15y in JAN shows appetite from non-domestics. On the fundamental side of things, the governments c1% growth target is everywhere but in the data. Technical recession in Q4 (GDP -0.2q +0.1y). Weak January activity indicators (47.8 mfg PMI 48.8 composite PMI). New car sales -7.6%y. Unsurprisingly, ANSA reported that the EU expects sub1% (0.2%y) growth in 2019. Adding to it, the IMF says there is no way Italy achieves 1% with the current policies. 
"
"On A Holiday From Hell. TCGLN ( Thomas Cook Group Plc ) had a summer from hell. The company failed to correctly anticipate demand in a year when hot weather disrupted normal travel, particularly in the UK. Its erroneous forecasts led it to report an annual loss and a suspension of its dividend last November, missing estimates that had been lowered twice already. The 5-year risk premium took a beating at the time – it shot up from 400bps to 1288bps - and investors have been nervous ever since. So, when the company announce this morning that it will conduct a strategic review of its airline operation as it seeks to regain some financial flexibility, there was a huge sigh of relief among them. TGNLN said that all options are on the table and could range from a joint venture to an outright sale of the carrier through an auction which could fetch up to GBP1.1Bln according to analysts, as the airline would bring to the buyer the benefit of guaranteed sales, with package holiday guests occupying 45% of seats on the fleet of 103 planes. This rare piece of good news allowed TCGLN’s 5-year risk premium to close another 36bps tighter at 1169bps. That is 136bps tighter than the recent wides reached at the close on Tuesday.
"
"When In A Hole, Stop Digging. ArcelorMittal (MTNA) was under pressure today, with its 5y CDS wider by c15bp and its stock down -5%. That happened despite ever higher metal prices YTD. The move was caused by the evacuation of c700 people living near its dormant Serra Azul tailing dam, as precautionary measure. The dam has not broken yet, but analysts are divided on how big the financial impact can be. On the other side of the Atlantic, the outlook is not much brighter. MTNA’s South African subsidiary AMSA has registered its 1st profit in ~10y thanks to higher margins (metal prices up), higher volumes, lower costs. But demand from South Africa is still sluggish (less growth in infrastructure projects) and imports from China have established a fierce competition. Despite bad news, it is not a credit story yet. Leverage is still around 1x and MTNA has a solid liquidity. It has $2.4B cash on its balance sheet and another $5.5B disponible from credit facilities. Net debt is higher $10.2B, but the short-term maturities ‘only’ amount to $3.2B ($1.3B CP $1.0B loans $0.9B bonds). Management’s commitment on leverage and ‘small’ dividend & buyback programme are also reassuring in the medium term.

"A Bit Of Fresh Air. Since the year 2000, spectrum auctions in the telecom industry tend to send shivers down credit investors’ spine, as they remember the pile of debts operators had to assume when they first positioned themselves. Late last week, Switzerland announced the results of the sale of additional mobile spectrum intended to allow mobile network operators (MNO) to launch 5G services. And the results were surprisingly benign. Altogether, the three Swiss MNO spent a combined CHF380mln. Salt, MATTER’s (Matterhorn Telecom Holding SA) unit, had to spend a mere 0.1CHF per Megahertz per population, far below the roughly CHF0.4 operators had to spend during a similar auction in Italy. They were able to secure a blend of spectrum in the low, mid and higher frequency bands, including some in the valuable 700mHz and 1400MHz. Even better for existing operators, Dense Air, the London based telecom firm, dropped out of the bidding process, putting to rest rumours that it was poised to enter the swiss market as the country’s fourth MNO. After the stress they had to endure early last week when news of the potential merger between Sunrise and UPC Schweiz left them facing the prospects of Salt being squeezed by an enlarged competitor, MATTER’s investors cheered the results and sent the company’s 5-year risk premium another 20bps tighter at 414bps. That is 53bps tighter than the wides reached Thursday night before the auction results.
"
"Simply Weak Or Wounded?. When PUBFP ( Publicis Groupe ) published a weak set of results last week and announced that Q4 organic revenues declined by -0.3% rather than the +2.5% increase analysts were expecting, they sent a shockwave through the investors’ community. Evidence is mounting that core advertisers are spending less which is increasingly becoming a structural rather cyclical issue for the industry. The risk premium of the whole sector increased on the back of it in the second part of last week, and people were bracing themselves for OMC’s ( Omnicom Group Inc. ) results. To the relief of investors, they came in line with estimates. In contrast to PUBFP, OMC reported a fourth quarter organic growth of 3.2%. And today, while PUBFP’s 5-year risk premium kept drifting wider (+1bp @ 72bps), OMC’s tightened back (-3bps @ 61bps). But the chief executive of OMC issued a note of caution. “When you are running a company, you don’t mind it when your competitors are weak” he said. “You really don’t like it when your competitors are wounded, because they tend to do things that they would not do if they were simply weak. It’s been a rather competitive environment the last six months or so…”

"Watch Your Back. UniVision (UVN) spread was wider today (5y CDS +65 cash -1/-1.5pt), as Q4 results missed, and confirmed the downtrend in revenue. The 5y CDS now pays 550bp and looks like it is at an intermediate juncture between distressed and low-beta HY names. Audience trends are worsening (especially among target Spanish-speaking people). UVN has already lost its leading position to Comcast Corp (CMCS, IG, owns NBCUniversal, which itself owns Telemundo). Another patent-related story might also weigh on UVN sentiment. Indeed, UVN may have infringed DISH patents by using its technology that adapts the quality of streaming content based on available bandwidth, without paying a license. On the positive side of things. UVN has repaid $550m debt in 2018 incl $210m in 4Q, and according to management, the plan is to continue reduce debt, using FCF, in 2019. Another way to reduce debt could be asset sales. In particular, UVN announced plans to sell English-language digital assets. Last year, those assets contributed $2m to EBITDA. This is small compared to the potential sales proceeds (up to $100m). Management explicitly committed to use sales for debt payment. Sales are still pending, though. For now, Entreprise Value (8.5x) more than covers Net Debt (7.3x), which argues for a reversal towards 400s on the 5y CDS. But in the medium term, subscription losses and M&A; uncertainty could prove challenging for credit.

"The Power Of France. First of all, this isn’t about rugby. EDF released an encouraging set of 2018 results, with EBITDA +11% to €15B. Although low beta, the CDS was tightened 30bp YTD. From 80bp to 50bp. This €15B EBITDA was top of their target range. The main driver was France’s power supply. This division’s EBITDA soared c20%, to >€6B. And in the same time, net debt was stable-ish at €33B (€2B disposals vs €3B investments). Thus, leverage has improved to 2.2x from 2.4x, the year before. The trading range of this low-beta 50bp-paying CDS over the past 3 years has been [40bp,140bp]. And there are reasons to think it will stay in the lower part of that range, this year. Indeed, 2019 guidance for EBITDA is €15.3-16B. And it looks conservative, as it accounts for the fact that current French tariff freezes might impact EBITDA adversely. The dividend payout ratio was maintained <50%. The French government (>80% stake) is committed to keep its scrip option until 2020. To preserve credit rating is also something management is committed on. So it looks like EDF will remain a boring if not tragic equity story (the stock has lost >80% of its value since its pre-GFC peak), but on the credit side, things look good for this A-/A-/A3 utility.

"No WIN For Windstream. When US High Yield investors left for a long week-end on Friday, they were certainly not expecting the brutal punishment that was inflicted on WIN ( Winstream ) during today’s session. The very survival of the company is under threat after the surprise ruling late last week by a Manhattan federal court that it defaulted on its debt by spinning off Uniti Group Inc in 2015. It contends that some of WIN’s bondholders were unfairly stripped of assets that backed up their investment. The judgement was made on the back of an action undertaken by Aurelius Capital Management, but the $310mln awarded to the fund could only be the beginning. Other creditors could claim cross defaults on other parts of WIN’s debt which totals roughly $5.8Bln. The ruling means that creditors could ask their trustees to file notices to accelerate their debt and seek immediate repayment. WIN’s bonds were trashed, and the company’s 5-year risk premium reached 70% upfront. That means you have to pay 70cts upfront to insure $1 of WIN’s debt against a default within 5 years, and an additional 5cts per year. The market now assesses that WIN has only 1 in five chances to make it through the next 12 months. 
"
"One Strike Too Far. There is an overhang of protection in the market after the last few weeks and no one seems too keen to pick it up. Some of it was housed in options that expired today, and some short covering took place on the back of it. But generally speaking, it was a relatively quiet option expiry. The market has rallied so hard over the last 10 sessions – not to mention the rally since the beginning of the year that took investment grade credit indices 28bps tighter to 61bps in the US and 27bps tighter in Europe to 66bps! -, that all the strikes with a large open interest (around 70 and 75bps on iTraxx Main and 325bps on iTraxx Crossover) were broken long ago and were too far to have any meaningful impact on today’s trading pattern. iTraxx Main (ITXEB) reached current series’ tights, and nothing can stop the move at the moment. The spread between ITXEB and iTraxx Financial Senior, which is a good “bullishness” indicator of the market was down another bp today – it closed at 14bps -, despite the widening of BTPs against bund. Many investors who were holding short risk positions have been forced to throw the towel, and with the roll within sight, it will take a very brave man to call the end of the rally.

"All That Glitters…. Despite several deal failures over the past decades, Barrick Gold (ABX) offered an aggressive $17.8B to acquire Newmont Mining Corp (NEM). This follows 2 major developments in that industry, last month: 1/ ABX and Randgold merged to create the biggest worldwide player 2/ NEM had itself bid $10B to acquire Goldcorp. Because ABX’s bid for NEM is at a c8% discount (NEM’s current market cap is $19.4B), NEM stocks fell along with ABX (-1.7%), despite the risk-on mood. NEM CEO unsurprisingly said it would be bad for shareholders, and added that the option to buy ABX was actually on the table. Those developments were taken positively in credit, probably helped by the fact that the ABX-NEM deal would be all-share. The prospect that no cash would be burnt took NEM 5y CDS tighter -12 on day, coming from low 60s to low 40s (this AM) then back to low 50s (now). ABX CDS is little moved (-3bp, roughly in line with IG31 -2.5bp), still in mid 60s. Elsewhere in commodity space, oil did not glitter, after Trump talked crude prices down: ""Oil prices getting too high. OPEC, please relax and take it easy. World cannot take a price hike - fragile!"" That didn’t hurt CDS (US IG, US HY, EM), confirming the non-linearity that applies when WTI is above $55.
"
"Healthy Q4 For Tenet. Tenet Healthcare Corp (THC) saw its 5y CDS tighten by more than 60bp today, after communicating solid 4Q results and positive 2019 guidance. The stock was also up more than 10% intraday. In effect, EBITDA growth guidance range midpoint was unexpectedly lifted from 4.0% to 5.5%. While 2018 EBITDA was aided by cost savings and improving admissions trends, the 2019 one can potentially be helped by stronger Medicare rate increases. Net leverage (5.6x) was down compared to last year, illustrating the management’s continued commitment. With cash of c$0.4B and $1B revolving credit facility, Tenet had $1.4B liquidity on hand. Additionally, during the earnings call, it was confirmed that THC has entered an exclusivity agreement on its financial services unit (Conifer). But the CEO failed to give many more details on the topic. In particular, it is not clear yet that the Conifer sale (potential) proceeds would be totally used to de-leverage, as opposed to favour shareholders. Other risks ahead include the possible repeal of the Affordable Care Act and some struggling hospitals in Illinois. Those risks might make it more challenging than expected to achieve the <5x leverage goal by the end of this year. 
"
"The Price Of Being Late. The veteran British retailer Marks & Spenser Plc (MARSPE) was both the best-performing CDS in iTraxx Main (tighter -25bp) and the worst-performing stock in FTSE 100 (-12.5%). The 5y CDS has tightened almost 100bp in less than two months. The news that provoked this is that MARSPE is acquiring 50% of Ocado UK for £750M (50%/50% joint venture), but it will be equity financed (rights issue £600m + deferred consideration). Moreover, MARSPE is also cutting 40% its dividend, with this year's final payout falling to 7.1p, down from 11.9p last year, taking total dividends for the year to 13.9p, down from last year’s 18.7p. This cut can save MARSPE c£120m per year. Longer term, the good news is that MARSPE will now have a full online delivery service, a turn which many of its peers had taken for years. Analysts expect current Ocado customers (currently the partnership is with Waitrose) to stay on Ocado, despite the fact that Waitrose has created its own platform. But in the short term, the equity market makes it look like an overpay. The antagonist reaction of MARSPE (-12.5%) and Ocado (+3%) stocks speaks by itself. 
"
"Hit Price. HP Inc. (HPQ) 5y CDS is the worst-performer in CDX IG s31, wider +13bp. Not huge in absolute but c20% relative on this spread. In parallel stocks declined c20% (worst in 7 years). This is after HPQ’s warning on printer supplies sales, one of the highest margin products it sells. Weaker demand from €zone can potentially take those sales down -3% yoy. Interestingly another factor into this lower guidance is the fact that people buy those more and more on the internet. And unfortunately for HPQ, its market share is much higher in shops than online, which makes it miss an increasingly high share of the market. Adding to that, Q4 sales missed ($14.7B vs $14.9B exp). Component shortages one of the causes of the miss. HPQ had lost its leadership in PC sales last year (to Lenovo). In terms of credit metrics, not much to mention really. Net debt is sub $1B, as the company sits on $5B of cash. Net debt / EBITDA is sub 0.2x. A conservative management improved HPQ credit profile since 2016, where the wides of this CDXIG veteran member (in since s04!) were above 200bp. 
"
"Pre-Roll Tightness. The luxury retailer Nordstrom Inc. (JWN) delivered mixed results overnight, including lower than forecast like for like sales in Q4 +0.1% (vs +1.2% est) and an EPS beat of $1.48 (vs $1.42 est). Guidance was also strong: FY19 EPS $3.65-$3.90 (vs $3.55 estimates). That took the stock up (+4%) and the 5y CDS tighter (-11bp). That being said, the big picture isn’t all rosy, in an increasingly challenged retail sector. Leverage came at 2.7x, still above the 1.5-2.5x target range’s top point. FCF dropped $180M. And despite that, JWN bought back $520M stocks, funded mostly by existing cash. This may attract agencies attention and lead to an outlook change, from the current Baa1 (Stable)/BBB+ (Stable)/BBB+ (Stable). So the credit picture is not as rosy as you could imagine while looking at the time series. However, with the roll coming in 2 ½ weeks, there has been quite little appetite to bid for single-name protection, of late. Thus, JWN 5y CDS tightens back to the lowest spread level, since last November. Elsewhere it was a relatively neutral session for US CDS, with CDX indices trading in tight ranges. 
"
"Melting Tighter. Picard BondCo SA (PICSUR) manufactures and sells frozen food products. It saw its French LFLs decrease -4% vs previous year, in a quarter that was key for this issuer, given that it included both Christmas and New Year. And weaker French consumer confidence (largely driven by the ‘yellow vest’ protests) did not help, in this respect. Margin having been roughly stable, EBITDA fell -5% (€85m) vs previous year. Despite that not great news, the 5-year CDS is tighter by c25bp on the day, after showing -50bp intra session, because PICSUR leverage came down in the quarter. Leverage decline resulted from a surprisingly stronger FCF, spurred by strong NWC (€100m). The positive surprise came from the current liability side of the equation (i.e. lower payables). Thus, PICSUR liquidity has optically improved from €40m to €200m. I write ‘optically’ because that is probably not here to stay, especially if this single-B-rated retailer’s sales keep declining... The investor call scheduled on March 8 at 2PM (London time) might give us more colour, but the fact that Easter occurs quite late this year (April 21) means that will not cushion PICSUR leverage, next quarter. Additionally, it is worth noting that demand for single-name protection has been very subdued lately, in € HY space, partly due to the March roll coming soon.
"
"Washer + Dryer = Wider. Dutch banks came under pressure in late morning, ING leading the way (snr CDS +3 sub CDS +6). That is because Dutch banks were mentioned in a Russian money laundering case in the paper Telegraaf. Indeed, some leaked documents from 2 Lithuanian banks suggest Rabobank, ABN Amro and ING have been involved in a major Russian money laundering case in which billions of euros were laundered in Europe and the US. The documents show they were involved in payments that have the characteristics of money laundering, and almost €1bn passed from Lithuanian banks to Dutch bank accounts. The Danske Bank saga shows us that this type of stories can hurt CDS, although the names are well capitalised (fully loaded CET1: ABN 18.4% ING 11.4% Rabo 16%). That largely helped the SnrFin index to widen from 74 ½ to 77 in London late morning. Elsewhere, swiss banks were also underperforming as the Italian financial police demanded them to disclose the names of bankers working in Italy. This is less than a month after a French court ordered UBS to pay €5B for helping French clients to launder their assets. The upcoming iTraxx roll, the more positive Brexit outlook and the expectation of a new round of ECB TLTROs have largely contributed to pull European financial CDS tighter year to date. Thus, the sector is vulnerable to a reversal, and has differentiated itself by seeing some appetite to bid single-name protection.
"
"Expectation Management. Schaeffler (SHAEFF) is among worst performing names in the Xover today, wider by c10bp (c20bp intra day) while the index is wider ‘only’ by c6bp. This is after a weak release of results. On the financial data side, 2018 results and 2019 guidance (revenue growth 1-3% vs 3% exp.) missed the estimates, and the 2020 guidance dropped (which was kind of expected). That miss comes despite the company had issued 2 profit warnings in 2018. The miss is mainly driven by the Automotive division, as opposed to the Industrial one, and it weakens credit metrics. With net debt at €2.5bn, net leverage now stands at 1.2x (up from 1.0x in 2017). Additionally. On the bond supply side, SHAEFF announced it plans to issue bonds based on 2018 results and depending on market conditions. Speaking of market conditions, it is somehow surprising that SHAEFF paces up issuance, now that ECB APP net purchases are behind us. Those will add to the c€2bn outstanding, maturing between 2020 and 2025.
"
"Deviating From Roll Gravity. The ECB GC meeting had seemingly set a risk-on tone at 12.45 when we got the release, but it turned bearish for most markets later. At first, CDS indices tightened on the prospects of a new round of TLTROs and ‘lower for longer’ rates (ECB is now committed to keep depo rate at -0.4% until 2020). Indeed, CDX IG started the session by tightening 2bp, before widening back 2.5bp. This is still relatively strong, compared to stocks (SPX -0.7%). The second key development was the continued convergence between CDXIG and the Main. Main-IG spread was indeed negative for most of the session and closed around flat. In stocks, € outperformed US too (SXXP -0.4% SPX -0.7%). On ECB 1245 release, SX5E jumped +10 vs SPX +1. This shows the dragging CTA/profit-taking force at play in SPX. Before today, CTAs had reduced ~1/3 longs in SPX. And because they tend to unwind over c12 business days, this caps any short-term rally. We have broken 2,750, which is, the average YTD entry point of CTAs in SPX. Therefore more volatility is to expect on the downside, possibly pushing CDXIG wider than Main, in the short term. 
"
"Welcome Back. Teck Resources (TCK) is a Canadian diversified mining company (copper, steelmaking coal, zinc and energy). Now in the tight quarter of the CDX HY, the name will be coming back in the CDX IG index from next March 20, after spending 3.5 years in HY. This is as TCK has been upgraded by Fitch to BBB- (=) in FEB and by Moody’s to Baa3 (=) in JAN. Now the 5y CDS pays c127bp, after ranging [100,200] over the past year or so. But due to its exposure to commodity price volatility, this CDS can be less well-behaved. In its history, this quite cyclical name has peaked ~1,500bp (GFC) and ~2,000bp (commo crash in 2015). It was a long way since then. Indeed, last year, TCK generated $4.9B EBITDA, from $4.3B $2.6B $1.6B the years before. FCF was +$1.1B from -$0.6B in 2015. Today it looks more credit-friendly than before the 2015 commodity slump, as dividend payout came from 50%+ to c5% now. Moreover, its net leverage has stabilized below 1x, over the past few quarters, and its liquidity position has improved to almost $6B. That being said, lower commodities, production disruptions, fast FCF burn due to high capex requirements remain potential risks. 
"
"Grounded. Boeing (BA) 5y CDS was the worst-performing member of CDX IG, wider by 10bp, after the second deadly crash of one of its new planes in Africa. In parallel, the stock opened -12.5% before paring half of that move (still +23% YTD). The 737 Max plane is the newest/bigger version of the 737 (itself c1/3 of BA Op. Profit). Countries such as China and Indonesia, ordered companies to keep these planes inactive. We are talking of about 100 jets in China alone. This development comes at a crucial juncture, as analysts expected BA to enjoy a fast-growing EPS in the years to come (20.2 in ‘19 23.6 in ‘20 from current 17.9), after strong investments in CapEx. BA is probably not a credit story in the short term, it sits on c$9B of cash, short-term debt is c$3B, but history shows that industrial accidents can quickly dampen credit outlook. For instance, once VW admitted they cheated on emissions, back in September 2015, its 5y CDS went from c75bp to c300bp.
"
"Which Brexit?. Today was characterized by divergent price actions in CDS and FX worlds. While most look at GBP (spot, points, vols) to gauge Brexit sentiment, other asset classes did not follow it closely today, in particular, UK high-yield CDS. While the GBP undoubtedly came under pressure (-0.6% vs USD -1.1% vs EUR), we can see on the above chart that UK names were actually the outperformers in HY CDS space. A lower GBP tends to create an optical outperformance of UK assets (equities), compared to Eurozone ones (today UKX +0.3% vs SXXP -0.1%). But most of the UK HY names present in the XOver would be arguably more vulnerable, in case of a ‘hard’ growth-destroying Brexit. Fundamentals aside, it seems that the answer for this price action divergence resides in technicals. While short gamma players have tended to exacerbate price action in GBP, the strong performance in high-yield single-name CDS can be partly explained by the skew activity, in that space. Minutes before the schedule for a 2nd meaningful vote, Reuters reported that the deal was expected to lose by c100 votes, similar to last week’s report by the Telegraph. Adding to that, HuffPost UK just reported that a 3rd meaningful vote was getting pencilled for next Monday (Mar 18), just days before the EU summit (Mar 21-22). 
"
"Ugly Duckling. Today was a non-eventful session for EM sovereign CDS, with CDX EM s30 constituents moving between -2bp and +5bp, except Argentina (ARGENT). Indeed, ARGENT 5y CDS widened another c20bp, as $ARS has risen c6% month to date, touching a record low vs $ above 42. This widening is despite the approaching roll, but it is not illogical as ARGENT dec23-jun24 roll is likely to be around flat. This risk premium getting priced in in both markets reflects the uncertainty around tomorrow’s inflation print. The consensus expects +3.6% MOM. A much higher number would put CDS under widening pressure. The strategy of the BCRA to reduce money supply to support FX can be seen as dangerous because it can impact the real economy adversely if it lasts, while we have a key election on the agenda in October. Seen from here, Macri seems likely to be re-elected. The first provincial election of the 2019 electoral process, last weekend, resulted in the victory of the incumbent MPN against the candidate which was backed by Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. This was arguably not a surprise, as the MPN effectively rules that province since 1983 (and the return of democracy…), but it was a positive first signal. 
"
"Little Short-Term Pain . Casino (COFP) 5y CDS was standing among EUR HY retail underperformers today, as full year 2018 results were a bit of a mixed bag. Headline came in line, FCF came weak in France, along with liquidity, also weak, but a further asset disposal programme was announced. The French group retail EBIT (core business) was up +12% YoY, but FCF in France was once again weak. FCF post dividends and hybrid interest came -€165M due to large recurring one-offs (-€220M) and a working capital outflow (€133M). This was despite a drop in CAPEX (asset disposal €400M). That being said, today’s move can be seen as some king of consolidation. Indeed, the 5y CDS is coming from c640bp early 2019. We are now south of 430bp. This is as net debt fell to €2.7B from €3.7B. Liquidity has improved too. But not by that much. Despite the significant asset disposal (€1B in 2018), COFP cash position has only improved by €225M, now €2.1B. This is set to continue, as per guidance. COFP will increase its asset disposal target to €2.5B by Q120 (in total = €1B increase). Short-term issues have been pushed back for now, as COFP has €1.2B bond maturities in the next 12 months vs cash position €2.1B. 
"
"Compression?. Swiss Re (SCHREI) has seen its sub 5y CDS widen +10bp today, thus underperforming the broader reinsurance sector (MUNRESUB +4bp HANRUESUB +1bp) following the issuance of €750M subordinated 31-year notes at 245bp above DBR. SCHREISUB (+10) has also underperformed the senior CDS (SCHREI +2), thus decompressing +6bp today, on a 1:2 basis. Noteworthy that since the Jan 3 peak in spreads, SCHREISUB has tightened 46bp and it was flat vs SCHREI, on a 1:2 basis. To some extent, the sub/snr ratio has been resilient to the direction of spreads. SCHREI sub/snr compression trade might have looked attractive because the ratio (currently 2.5x) is higher than insurers’ (AEGON ASSGEN AXASA & AVLN are closer to 2x). However, it was not until now, particularly low compared to other reinsurers’ sub/snr ratios (HANRUE 2.8x MUNRE 3.1x). This was because, although there was a SCHREI bond to deliver into the senior CDS (for ex the 2 7/8 2022s), there was none to deliver into the sub CDS. The swiss insurer Zurich (ZURNVX), in the same situation, has its sub/snr also equal to 2.5x. This new sub issuance can thus potentially change the dynamic in SCHREI sub/snr CDS ratio.
"
"Stronger Together?. Deutsche Bank (DB) was the outperformer in SnrFin and SubFin CDS indices today, its 5y senior CDS is tighter -8bp, sub is -20bp. This is as DB and Commerzbank (CMZB) are now officially in merger talks, according to company releases. We basically moved from unofficial talks to official talks. This was after the government signalled it wouldn’t stand in the way of necessary job and cost cuts. The Finance Ministry is still in contact with both parties, Scholz having been favouring a deal for months. Germany’s government's will is important, and it will probably stay that way, as reportedly their preferred option is to maintain a stake in the new proforma entity. As DB is the bigger entity, it would probably be the acquirer, but for that it needs c€8B. That could come from an equity raise, but shareholders have been tapped c€30B over the past decade. So more likely from DWS 78% stake sale (c€4.8B market value). That capital raise is indeed good for credit, therefore we see DB spreads tightening towards CMZB’s. Today we learnt that Allianz is interested in DWS. Although the odds of a deal have undoubtedly gone up, some hurdles remain (DB shareholders’ & regulators’ approvals). 
"
"Atlantic Spread. The iTraxx Main (-1.7bp) outperformed its US counterpart, the CDX IG (-0.9bp) on the day, taking the ‘Atlantic spread’ back to less than a basis point, as we are the day before the roll. This cross-region spread was trading above 5bp a month ago. While the market might underestimate the probability of a technical No Deal Brexit at the end of this month, the momentum in Europe was particularly strong over the past 5 weeks, as evidenced in the rally in SXXP (+7.6% since Feb 13, vs ‘just’ +4.3% for S&P; 500) and the compression of non-core EGBs vs Bunds (10y BTP -40bp vs. DBR). More recently in cash space, Europe also outperformed the US (QW5A -6bp since Mar 7, while IBOXIG is roughly unchanged). The main tail risk for that direction to hold would be a Brexit without a deal on March 29, although this event looks unlikely. The UK Parliament has voted against a no-deal Brexit, but the default option remains an exit without a deal. This is in the unlikely event where the EU does not agree to grant the UK an Article 50 extension after this deadline. Although some key EU countries have voiced that the extension would not come without a satisfactory reason from the UK, the market participants are largely expecting an unanimous agreement from the EU side at the end of this week to avoid a disorderly Brexit. German Chancellor Merkel repeated today that avoiding a no-deal Brexit was, for her, a priority. A headline also just popped, stating that the EU side was said to see mid-April as the deadline for the UK to decide on Brexit delay. 
"
"Roundup’s Round Two. Bayer AG (BAYNGR) saw its 5y CDS (note that 5y now designates the June 2024, as opposed to the December 2023) widen by c25bp and its stock fall by c13%, after an overnight Monsanto-linked legal headwind. The San Francisco jury has ruled against BAYNGR, concluding that Roundup was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff's cancer. This is not yet a finding of Bayer's liability. Liability and damages will now be decided in a 2nd trial phase beginning on Wednesday. This is the 2nd case for BAYNGR, having previously seen a Californian court award $289M against it, although this figure was later reduced to $78M on appeal. Dealers talk about a potential 1-notch downgrade across agencies. BAYNGR is currently BBB s/Baa1 n. The market wonders about the scope for a settlement tied to Glysophate trials. Settlements could in total exceed $5B. Some analysts believe that close to $20bn is priced in the shares, at this level. The series is poised to continue, as a 3rd glyphosate case in Missouri is due to start next week. The catalysts next in line will also include 1/ a St Louis case in early April 2/ news around disposals including Currenta and its Animal Health division. The latter could reportedly be worth $9B on its own.
"
"Deal Or No Deal. Today PM May was in Brussels and formally requested a one-off 3-month Brexit delay. But EU leaders want a shorter cut-off than that. And they made it clear that this was contingent to May getting her deal passed in Parliament. This development, days before the March 29th deadline, got echo in the market. At a macro level, the spread iTraxx Main and CDX IG got back positive and wider, up 3.5bp today, going from -1bp to +2.5bp. The spread between their respective fair values also came back in positive territory (i.e. Europe wider), at +0.5bp. The single-name performance dispersion displayed demonstrates the UK risk underperformance further. Indeed, UK names widened the most (ITVLN +13 bank holdcos +10) in the iTraxx Main. In parallel, in other markets, Gilts rallied aggressively to 1.06% on the 10-year point, the lowest yield since Q3-2017, and in FX, the 1-month ATM GBP$ implied vol picked up to 13.5, a level last seen in December. 
"
"Roasted 2.0. Turkey went under pressure today with its currency depreciating about 6% vs USD intra day and its CDS closing more than 50bp wider. This is following a succession of developments. 1/ The main factor is speculation the CBT might be using reserves to support the currency before local elections on March 31. According to Bloomberg, the central bank’s weekly balance sheet reported that net international reserves fell -$6.3B in the two weeks through March 15 to $28B. That decline was unexpected and unexplained. 2/ The macro backdrop is that growth concerns cast doubts in EM sentiment, despite more dovish DM central banks’ stances. In particular, the US rates curve inverted between the 3m point and the 10y, for the first time since…2007! 3/ Comments by Erdogan criticizing Trump’s stance on Golan Heights could have been expected, realistically, but are still a sign of divergences between Turkey and the US, on the geopolitical front. 4/ With the elections approaching (Mar 31 / mayors and municipal councilors will be elected), demand for USD has picked up significantly from both local and offshore accounts. 5a/ Snowball effect: this PM, brokers including JP Morgan advised clients to go long $TRY targeting 5.90, although that’s now just 2.5% from us. They argued that political authorities will pay less attention to lira stability post Mar 31 elections, and that the pace of FX reserve consuming is unsustainable. 5b/ The rating agency Fitch added said that they expect Turkey to contract in 2019. In reaction to these market developments, the CBRT tightened supply by effectively suspending its 1-week 24% repo facility for an unknown period of time. A hike at this point in time would probably not please Erdogan much. CBT also argued that the drop in reserves was not due to an extraordinary situation, and that they remained committed to accumulating FX reserves. Adding to this, the Minister of Finance Albayrak said that Turkey will post a CAS in summer, that 2019 GDP growth would surpass the 2.3% expectation and that inflation would slow down back to single digits in Q3. Those ‘reassuring’ comments failed to stop the lira from weakening, post CDS effective close. The last time I entitled a comment about Turkey ‘Roasted’ was on August 10. For reference, back then, Turkey CDS was 40bp wider, TRY was 17% lower vs USD, TRY 1w repo rate was 625bp lower, 10y US yields were 40bp higher.
"
"Good Grades Matter. Auchan Holding (AUCHAN) is the worst-performing CDS in iTraxx Main today, wider +10bp, after the S&P; announcement on Friday that they revised its outlook to negative. That makes the French retailer on the brink of high-yield, as they are now rated BBB-n at S&P.; Causes for the change included 1/ Higher leverage (4.5x key level breached) 2/ Weak competitive position in main markets (i.e. France, Italy & Russia) 3/ Transformation plan is taking longer than initially thought… 4/ … and is causing bigger than expected restructuring costs. While leverage currently stands at 4.5x (as of FY18, mainly due to high capex), S&P; still expects it to improve to the 3.6x-3.7x area, by the end of the year. Achieving this therefore seems key for Auchan to keep its IG rating, and S&P; explicitly said that if their EBITDA margin doesn’t stabilize above 4% in FY19 (for reference, it was 3.9% in FY18), the firm could become HY, unless that is mitigated by other credit positives. Potential credit positives could include a/ asset disposals b/ capex reduction c/ further dividend suspension. It seemingly didn’t come as a surprise for many, as FY18 results had confirmed a weak trading performance with negative LFL growth and a -16% decline in EBITDA, largely due to a still intense price competition. Similarly, a potential downgrade this year would possibly not come as a surprise to some, but would most likely be followed by a material widening in spreads. Similarly, but at a higher level in the rating scale, Carrefour (CAFP, BBBs / Baa1n / BBB+s) was downgraded by S&P; despite transformation plan progress, due to high competition and further restructuring costs. Contrary to Auchan’s case, S&P; sees CAFP’s EBITDA margin returning to 5% in a 2y horizon.

"Perched. Boparan Finance PLC (BOPRLN) has been the worst performing retailer in CDS space, year to date. Indeed, its 5y CDS is wider by +50bp. Fundamentally, wage and food inflation (ex: feedstock +3.5% yoy) continue to squeeze margins while price increases are longer to come. That was reflected in Q1 (FY 18/19) results, with EBITDA at £24m vs £28m previous year (-14% yoy) and Q2 results are widely expected to be in line with Q1. Credit picture looks weak, net leverage is c7x if you exclude pension liabilities, c10x if you include them. BOPRLN has 3 issues, £ 5.25 19s £ 5.5 21s € 4.38 21s. The £ 19s are seen as likely to be repaid (expiry in July). With liquidity of just £160M and the £174M 19s going to expire, both the 21s and the CDS could come under more pressure. If the company survives that period, things would have had to improve, therefore the CDS curve is inverted from 3y (June 2022) onwards.
"
"United In Diversity. Renault SA (RENAUL) has been the best performing CDS in iTraxx Main. Its 5y CDS is tighter by -6bp vs +0.7bp on the index and +0.1bp on the average of the index constituents. In parallel, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (FCAIM) has been 3rd best performer in Xover, with its 5y CDS tighter by -18bp. This is after the FT reported that Renault aims to restart merger talks with Nissan within 12M and then acquire another carmaker, FCAIM being amongst the most likely ones. The recent creation of a new alliance board led by Renault chairman has seemingly improved confidence between the two sides. The potential further acquisition would make the group size able to compete with VW and TOYOTA. Ghosn reportedly tried to merge with FCAIM 3Y ago but the French government opposed it. FCAIM on its side, has lately been quite vocal about their willingness to find a merger partner. Those news took the FCA/RNO spread to 25bp, converging one step, between the BBB/Baa3 French group and the BBB-/BB+/Ba3 Italian one.
"
"One’s Pain Is Another’s Gain. Suedzucker (SZUGR) 5y CDS has widened c30bp since the Mar 20th roll. It announced a profit warning ahead of its FY results in May. SZUGR expects revenues €6.75b EBITDA €350m (lower end of the forecast range). That decrease is largely due to the sugar segment. SZUGR plans to write down €700m goodwill, facing restructuring charges of €150m (€100m due to write downs on fixed assets). The good news for credit (vs equity, all is relative) may be the dividend cut (€0.20 ps from €0.45), This saves €50m. SZUGR also announced it is likely to trigger the cashflow trigger (cashflow/revenue <5%) on its hybrid bond (ie they will not pay its coupon on for 1y = 4 quarters, until the covenant is tested again in 2020). This saves €20m. Looking forward, SZUGR expects for 19/20 revenues €6.7bn EBITDA €100m (with a loss of €200m-€300m in sugar). If net leverage effectively rises closer to 6x, it is likely to result in S&P; revising its outlook to Negative from BBB- s. That would arguably not be a game changer, as Moody’s rating is already Baa3n, which is why SZUGR has gone from iTraxx Main to Xover. Its CDS remains quite consistent with cash, with Z-spread of 160 on the 2023s and 190 on the 2025s.

"35-Year Can Kicking. Kawasaki Kisen (KAWKIS) is a transportation company which owns cargo ships, container ships & terminals, tankers and LNG carriers. It is also the highest beta name in iTraxx Japan this year. Today its 5y CDS tightened by -50bp, vs 1.25bp for iTraxx Japan, and -4/+2bp for other iTraxx Japan constituents. From mid FEB to mid MAR, KAWKIS 5y CDS had widened +230bp i.e. more than doubled, reaching a peak at c430bp before reverting to the current c305bp. The roll effect is not to be blamed here, as the roll is virtually nil. Today’s move comes after the news that it will get a JPY 45 billion subordinated loan from Mizuho, the Development Bank of Japan and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust. This 35y loan, due in 2054, will be used to repay debt and for capex on vessels. This confirms the MAR 21 Nikkei report, after KAWKIS announced that its full-year operating loss was forecast to come JPY 21B yen, instead of JPY 5B previously expected. The latter had caused most of the reversal from 400s to 300s in the CDS. 
"
"Reversion?. Koninklijke KPN N. V. (KPN) was among best performers in iTraxx Main today, 5y CDS being tighter by 10bp, vs -2.7bp for the index and -1.8bp for the index fair value. It follows the -14bp move on Friday. This outperformance is due to beta, but not only. Indeed, on Friday, S&P; upgraded KPN to BBB Stable from BBB- following the agency’s view that KPN credit metrics should cross its thresholds for a mid BBB rating despite potential restructuring charges. As a result, KPN is now Baa3/BBB. Management’s commitment to achieve a mid-term leverage below 2.5x likely helped that decision. S&P; also commented on a potential bid from Brookfield Asset Management, which caused the CDS spread to soar (55->130) earlier this year. We tighten back today also as the probability of this deal looks to have decreased. Indeed, the agency said that such a development is sufficiently remote for now, for a few reasons. Firstly, it believes that KPN’s independent foundation would use its voting control to block any offer that could be dangerous for lenders. Secondly, it argues that the recently proposed legislation in the Netherlands could allow the government to intervene in such a takeover. That making the path to a deal more complex for Brookfield, we logically reverted tighter to 115 mid on the 5y, which is still top of the range, as the deal is still far from off the table.
"
"Upside Risk?. Daimler AG (DAIGR) is tighter -4bp today, 11bp below Mar 20 close, 38bp below c2c YTD wide. Aside from macro market direction, DAIGR specific risks include 1/ the suggestion of emission wrongdoing including the unresolved US DoJ investigation ongoing since 2016 2/ potential for US-imposed tariffs. President Trump said he wanted auto tariffs would be >0, one could think that after US/CN talks end the Eurozone is next in line. Although the consensus thinks BMW is the most exposed to this threat, they think that could shave off c10% DAIGR’s EBITDA. If the US/CN negotiations are anything to go by, we could see an initial move to 25% tariff by the US, before reaching some truce. 3/ European truck litigation is not over, in the sense that trucks manufacturers have already paid fines for their role in fixing prices but they are now facing potential claims from the people who paid too much 4/ new allegations of cartel building among the German automakers. Der Spiegel had reported that the EU is preparing to fine each €1B. 5/ According to Bloomberg calendar, we get EU27 March new passenger car registration on Apr 17. It might be a catalyst, key to gauge European demand, as March tends to be the biggest month for sales volumes. Mar-2018 had printed -5% YOY. 6/ It seems fair to say that guidance change risk remains, given challenging conditions for the sector and upcoming management change (incl. CEO and CFO, effective May-2019 but announced since Sep-2018) at DAIGR. Finally, on a relative value basis, DAIGR looks at the tight end of the range vs its German peers. Indeed, DAIGR is -33bp tight to VW, vs a 1y range of [-40bp,-5bp]. DAIGR is only 11bp wide to BMW, vs a 1y range of [8bp,27bp]. 
"
"Cash Strain. Casino Guichard-Perrachon (COFP) saw its CDS widen by c30bp today, the sharpest move since last August, against a rather solid backdrop in Euro HY space (iTraxx Xover is tighter -6bp). The French retailer was downgraded by Moody's yesterday night, by 2 notches from Ba1n to Ba3n and leaves the outlook at negative. That means COFP is now Ba3n/BBn. This development comes in light of COFP’s weak FCF, limiting its ability to reduce gross debt despite large asset disposals. Moody’s sees COFP’s adjusted leverage at 7.5x vs 6.7x as of Q417. The change is also due to RALFP (+55bp) weak liquidity and persistently high leverage, which adds uncertainty on COFP’s future financial policy. Unless RALFP extends the maturity of its bank debt or obtains new sources of funding, it could run short of cash next year, according to Moody’s. In reaction, COFP stated that Moody’s analysis does not take into account COFP’s disposal plan or future reduction in bond debt. This should be nuanced as Moody’s acknowledged positively COFP’s additional €1B disposal plan. And this is why sell-side analysts (incl. Bernstein) seem to largely embrace Moody’s analysis. They repeat the point that asset sales are a short-term fix which does not solve structurally weak cash generation. A risk now is to see S&P; follow Moody’s, increasing the risk of COFP falling into single-B. In cash space, the move was broadly consistent with CDS, spreads coming up c30bp across the belly of the curve, leaving the basis still slightly positive. Stocks also fell (-3%). This is contrasting with UK retailers’ performance, as better Brexit sentiment and stronger Kantar data took TSCOLN -4bp SBRY -9bp. Indeed, UK supermarket sales rose 1.4% for the 12 weeks to Mar 24.  
"
"To Be Continued…. I had commented (Mar 18 - ‘Stronger Together?’) on DB outperforming € financials (snr CDS -8bp sub CDS -20bp), when DB and CMZB started officially merger talks, after the German government signalled it wouldn’t oppose to it. Today we saw a partial reversal of that move, DB lagged (CDS +3bp) and its stock fell up to -2% intra day, as DB would reportedly need to raise €3-5B of fresh equity to finance the CMZB deal. Reuters reported just now that the ECB will ask DB to raise new funds for merger. DB shareholders have already been tapped c€30B over the past decade, but the DWS stake sale (<€5B) is not enough here. On the CMZB side of the equation, an alternative (and still unlikely) path showed up today. According to the FT, UCGIM is preparing a rival bid for CMZB should the DB/ CMZB merger talks fall apart. The plan would be to acquire a sizeable stake in CMZB and merge it with HVB, UCGIM’s German arm. That would probably be felt as negative for DB credit short term, if Q1 price action is any guide. But this path remains a tail risk, because such a UCGIM/CMZB deal would need approval from the German government, which has expressed reluctance towards a cross-border merger, as it prefers a German national champion. Actually, UCGIM had previously showed interest in such a deal in 2017, where it already faced political opposition. We should know rather sooner than later. Indeed, CMZB was said to decide on DB talks on next Tuesday (April 9 – regular management meeting), according to WirtschaftsWoche. And Suddeutsche Zeitung even reported that a preliminary decision may be reached as early as this weekend. Adding to this UCGIM/CMZB tail scenario, some German politicians (CDU Gutting and SPD members) said they didn’t favour the DB/CMZB deal because of job cuts. European elections are in less than two months, and we can feet it. But if anything, the UCGIM/CMZB tail scenario could mitigate this position, as the DB/CMZB deal would look like the ‘least worst’ option.

"Milk and Honey?. In Q1, CDX HY has tightened -110bp, up c5% to the highest in more than 6 months. In cash space too, US HY bond funds got the biggest inflow in 10 weeks, close to $2B. HY bonds had their best Q1 since 2003, the Bloomberg Barclays US HY TRI gained +7.6%. Within the iBoxx HY index, the only sector which failed to tighten by more than 100bp in Q1 was ‘Consumer’. Low supply helped that move. Indeed, March supply came at $20.4b, down 21% from March 2018, making it the slowest 3rd month since 2009 and making Q1-2019 the lowest Q1 issuance since 2016. We saw 78 deals totalling $59B. And if supply slows, demand is still there, partly thanks to the Fed’s earlier change of path. Most deals were oversubscribed by multiple times. Other factors include better-than-feared earnings, firm oil (WTI highest in almost 6 months) and above all a dovish Fed (70% of a 25bp rate cut priced in by the end of this year). Indeed, we saw US financial conditions ease the most steeply since Feb16-Apr16 period, and yields we dragged down by the sharp rally in rates (10y yield went from 3 ¼ to 2 ½). The HY market seems very resilient to the increasing expectations of a US recession over the coming quarters. Indeed, the NY Fed sees the probability of a US recession in the next 12 months at 27%. UST 2s10s is not inverted but fairly flat (16bp) and historically, US recessions follow 2s10s inversions with an average lag of 18 months (22 months for GFC, 13 months for Dot Com etc). One might think that this is fine, because the curve shows a 2s10s priced 8bp steeper 1y forward. This is forgetting that prior to several recessions in the past, the Fed, panicked, eased and steepened the curve, failing to avoid the recession. The amplitude of that steepening reached ~2bp in 2s10s prior to both Dot Com and GFC.

"Shipping Names Rocked. Today CMA CGM (CMACG) and Hapag-Lloyd AG (HPLGR) were the 2 worst-performing names in Xover, wider by c50bp and c40bp resp., compared to ‘only’ 7bp for the index. The container shipping industry being highly cyclical, competitive and fragmented, those names are usual high-betas. Beyond that, while the tone has improved between the US and China on trade, and while the macro backdrop seems to have improved, it is worth noting that CMACG and HPLGR are almost at the widest level since late 2016. Regulation is part of the answer. Indeed, International Maritime Organization's (IMO 2020) sulphur regulation, which will ban ships from using any marine fuel with a sulphur content above 0.5% as of 01-Jan-20, is expected to impose a heavy burden on owners as the annual fuel costs for the shipping industry are likely to jump by up to $60B, including $10B for the containership sector alone. This could mean c$1B annual cost for both CAMCG and HPLGR. HPLGR said they expect the resulting costs to be passed on customers, but this remains to be seen, in the very competitive context. CMACG, on its side, announced a $1.2B cost-cutting plan to offset it. The acquisition of CEVA Logistics could add to CMACG c$430M EBITDA by 2021, with a broadly neutral impact on leverage, according to S&P; research. Bloomberg calculated that even if 50% of costs are passed on, HPLGR could still face re-leveraging of +1.5x to 4.5x ND/EBITDA. Worst case, net leverage could go to 8x by end-2020. CMACG net leverage is below 7x, and it trades c400bp wider. Fierce competition is making the names vulnerable, and just 5% decline in freight rates over 12M could shave off half of HPLGR EBITDA. For example, in 2018, Asia-Europe rates fluctuated between $1,200 per 40-foot box in H1 to $1,800 in August. Despite the structural seasonality of the rates, this volatility introduces a dissymmetry for CDS market participants.
"
"On The Red. Today the 5y CDS of Crown Resorts Ltd (CWNAU) widened by c22bp, thus clearly underperforming the iTraxx Australia index (+0.5bp). This is as the Las Vegas casino empire Wynn Resorts Ltd is in talks to buy CWNAU for cAUD10B as Wynn looks to grow in APAC. The proposed deal values CWNAU at a c25% premium, given its market cap was AUD8B pre stock move. As a result, CWNAU shares soared +20% in Sydney. The impact on CDS is trickier, market makers seemingly expect CWNAU to get closer to Wynn’s (Z-spread on the 4.25 2023s is north 200bp), but one risk to that view would be if CWNAU gets ringfenced, as is Wynn’s Macau business (WYNMAC). Another risk may be that the deal does not happen, as the parties have not come to terms yet. Indeed, Wynn had even said that the talks were suspended,  but the consensus is (seemingly, looking at price action) for a deal. As we are seeing a Ba3/BB- name potentially acquiring a BBB/BBB/Baa2, a potential downgrade is also high on the cards for CWNAU if the deal goes through.
"
"Impairment Bites. HEMA (short for 4 unpronounceable Dutch words) is a Dutch discount retailer operating in Western Europe. Today the 5y CDS of HEMA BondCo I B.V. (HEMABV) widened by c74bp, thus underperforming any constituent of iTraxx XOver (-3.25) but TCGLN (+76). HEMABV CDS was wider by more than 100bp at some point this AM, and bonds were down -7pts (low print at 89.5) but then CDS reverted to +74 and cash closed -3pts on seniors. The retailer reported an impairment of goodwill of €226M, on the occasion of its Q4-18 results release. That led to a net loss for the year 2018 of €233M. Without that it would have been a ‘nothing year’ at €7M net profit. Net sales were still up +3% and revenue was up +8.5%, but adjusted EBITDA was hammered -18% to +€39M. This was driven by two things mainly. Firstly, excess stock had to be cleared, incurring markdowns in Q4, and secondly, higher labour costs and rent costs (up by +4% and +11% respectively in the period). I don’t expect to former to be a macro risk in Europe, but it is often mentioned by economists as a potential risk to US corporate margins. In 2018, the balance sheet of HEMABV saw a decent cash burn (at the company scale), from €67M to €29M. Guidance was positive (positive LFL Q1 in BE/LU/FR) but not much clarity on future deleveraging for credit people did not help. If OpEx keep rising, and the pace of cash decreased sustains in the next few quarters, we may well see diverging spreads. Elsewhere in European HY, the firm tone continued today (XO -3.25), quite immune to slight macro weakness (Bund -2bp confirming negative territory & Stoxx reverting -0.3% in the afternoon), a bit similar to Friday in that respect. 
"
"Only Game In Town. Today, the ECB pretty much dictated the price action for financials, one day after one of the less eventful meetings in its history. As expected, the ECB remained on hold, leaving its policy rates and forward guidance unchanged. Further details on the terms of the new TLTRO III announced last month weren’t forthcoming. Nor did Draghi mention the possibility of the ECB using ‘tiered deposit rate’, although he said the ECB would look into the possible side effects of negative rates policy, especially on banks’ profitability. Details on TLTRO3 are now expected at June meeting, neither before nor after. Today the ECB took DB CDS wider as some are reportedly dubious about the potential DB-CMZB coming merger. Earlier, CMZB board members were said to seek a meeting to end deal talks. DB is therefore the worst performer on the day (+2 on snr non pref. +8 on sub). BBVA lagged a bit on the back of Turkey’s underperformance, along with UCGIM, that also said it faces a possible fine related to a EC investigation into antitrust allegations. Later in the session, Senior Financials whipsawed on Reuters reporting that policymakers were sceptical over tiering negative rates. Klaas Knot also said that the new round of LTROs should be “more conservative and less generous”, failing to prevent financial CDS indices to tighten -2.6bp (Senior) and -5.3bp (Sub) respectively. 
"
"That Is A Big Deal. In a decently risk-on session (CDX IG -2.8 CDX HY -8.9 SPX @ 2,900), the CDS of Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) outperformed the broader market, tightening by c65bp. Bonds are also 75-100bp tighter. That is because the oil giant Chevron Corp. (CVX) agreed to buy APC. The equity is valued $33B, which will be paid in stocks and cash (75/25: 0.3869 CVX shares and $16.25 in cash per APC share). That is a 39% premium therefore APC share soared towards the offer price (+23% on day). The transaction is expected to close in 2H19. CVX management doesn’t expect any regulatory issues. From a credit standpoint, CVX will assume $15B net debt from APC, making APC EV c$50B. CVX will issue 200M shares and pay $8B in cash. A very tight name, CVX widened 6bp to 33bp mid, making the APC/CVX spread tighten 71bp, from +70bp to -1bp! CVX is not really a story for credit. Indeed, CVX has c$9.4B cash on hand and past experience proves that it generates $8B+ FCF per year at $50-55/bbl crude (vs now WTI $64), so it looks unlikely that they will fund the non-share cash part (c$8B) with debt. And even in the unlikely event it would do that, the combined leverage would be somewhere around 1x. Adding to this point, the news that 1/ CVX expects to realize $2B synergies (proceeds partly used for debt reduction) 2/ CVX plans to sell $15-20bn of assets in 2020-2022 confirms that CVX credit is not in trouble anytime soon. Therefore the consensus expects CVX to keep its current rating (AA/Aa2), while APC will converge to CVX from its Ba1/BBB, although we don’t know if CVX will explicitly guarantee them. CVX aside, this news dragged all the US/Canada IG energy tighter, with Hess -22 Devon -15 Encana -13, partly because the market knew APC was a target and consolidation was expected. This acquisition shows the importance of size in this business, where the biggest and the most diversified players do well. 
"
"‘Digital Revolution’. Today the Main rebounded +1.75bp, after dipping c15bp in three weeks. Constituents, as an aggregate, were little changed (+0.3bp), but it is worth noting that Publicis (PUBFP) underperformed, in that respect, with its 5y CDS wider by 7bp. This is after PUBFP confirmed over the weekend that it will acquire Epsilon from Alliance Data for $4.4B (c10x EV/EBITDA) in cash, the deal is expected to close in Q3. Not an outright surprise, as PUBFP had said it was considering it (Reuters Apr 2). Epsilon is a major US player in data and targeted marketing solutions, so it confirms PUBFP willingness to take the digital turn. As both Laurent (Feb 12) and myself (Jul 19) have previously mentioned in this blog, the advertising sector is challenged (data-protection regulations, competition from tech and consulting firms), and there is a need for renewal. In this respect, the faster-growing digital segment can prove a decisive part of PUBFP strategy. That step helped PUBFP stock price (up almost +5% this morning) while it was -10% (same CDS move) on Jul 19. The deal will effectively cost $4B, after considering the tax step-up. Clearly lower than the $5B initially reported, on Apr 2. While PUBFP confirmed its 2019 outlook, this acquisition comes at a time when the company struggles to grow organically. Indeed, Q1 revenue slowed -1.6%, following Q4 -0.3%. The deal will be financed by cash and a 1y bridge loan (which has the potential to be renewed 2 x 6 months). PUBFP might end up finishing the bridge loan with senior bond debt issuance. Senior bonds could underperform in that case, it is worth noting that the latter ‘already’ trade c20bp tight to the CDS (looking at the 1 5/8 Dec24s). The operations takes PUBFP leverage immediately up to 1.8x from 0.8x, as of end-18 (€4.9B debt, €3.2B cash & equiv and €2.2B adj. EBITDA). PUBFP management is still committed to keep its BBB+s/Baa2s rating and expects full deleveraging after 4 years. To balance the impact for credit investors, PUBFP will suspend its share buyback plan, although it still is committed to its 45% dividend payout ratio, for the time being. 
"
"Ups and Downs. Today Turkey CDS outperformed EM sovereign space, tightening by 22bp vs 2.5bp for CDX EM and 3.3bp for its fair value. The headline *TURKEY IN TALKS WITH RAYTHEON TO BUY PATRIOT SYSTEM, KALIN SAYS helped TRY and thus CDS get firmer. For reference, Turkey had rejected a U.S. proposal to deliver one Patriot missile defense system on March 1st. That was conditional on Turkey abandoning the S-400 deal with Russia, and was the #1 driver of Turkey CDS lately, and the recount of Istanbul vote seems clearly behind, for now. Looking ahead. The CBT will hold its next meeting on next Thursday (April 25). It is (very) likely to leave rate @ 24%. Historically. The CBT prefers to keep real rate as close to 0% as possible (interest rates are neither halal nor inflation-reducing, as President Erdogan often noted), except when TRY sharply depreciates and/or when financial stability is threatened. Meaning we would need to see TRY keep stable and inflation moderate before CBT starts cutting. Inflation has slowed (c20% from c25% in Q4-18) esp. goods (c20% from c30% in Q4-18) but inflation expectations remain high (12m 15% 24m 12%) far higher than the permanent regime averages of c5% in 2013-17. CBT expects c15% by EOY and 2 upside risks remain: 1/ TRY weaker on geopolitical/macro 2/ commodity prices going higher. Also, lately CBT responded to TRY weakness by closing 1-week (1W) repo facility (25 March - 5 April) providing TRY funding @ O/N 25.5% instead of 1W 24%. How to temporarily hike by 150bp at no political cost. That technique is likely to come back on the table before any actual hike (Political bar higher. CBT not as independent as the Fed. Bad example). Interestingly one bank got TRY3B ($520M) from the CBT via the late liquidity window yesterday. Meaning it cost them 27% vs policy 24%. To be continued…

"Pacific Spread. Today Latin American risk underperformed in the EM sovereign CDS universe, despite +/- stable energy and metal prices, while Asia performed strongly. Argentina 5y CDS lagged the complex (wider +28 vs CDX EM tighter -1.3). Yesterday March inflation rose +4.7% MoM (core CPI @ fresh record highs at 55.5%). The BCRA announced afterwards that the banks of the $ARS non-intervention zone would be kept unchanged until EOY. That helped stabilize ARS (+0.6% in the short term). The government has also just announced it will freeze prices on 60 food products until at least the end of NOV. One month after the election. Which I think is the tail risk for Argentina. If it would be fairBrazil CDS also underperformed (wider +3) on pension reform uncertainty. The Constitution and Justice Committee session has now started. A vote on the pension reform proposal is still possible today. The only possible positive outcome seems to be if the proposal passes this stage without any changes. Reports suggest that centrist parties are demanding pension text changes. Even if the proposal goes through today, it is worrying that the pension reform is stumbling at such an early stage of Lower House approval. A long way to go. Mexico CDS was stable (just -1). AMLO cancelled the education reforms from previous administrations via a memorandum. No economic impact, but AMLO exerting his authority via memorandums does not bode too well. Reversely, Asian names were rather strong. Chinese data were all beating expectations. GDP q1 6.4% y/y vs exp 6.3% and 6.3% prev. IP 6.5% y/y vs exp 5.6% and 5.3% prev. Retail Sales 8.7% y/y vs exp 8.4%. Fixed Assets 6.3% y/y as exp and 6.1% prev. China CDS was thus tighter -2. New post-GFC tight for China @ 39 ¼ and Indonesia even stronger (-3 ½) as the incumbent Jokowi won a 2nd five-year term, based on unofficial private co counts (reliable in past). Indon CDS @ 90 still 10bp above Jan-18 dip.

"‘Crazy Bernie’. The healthcare sector has weighed on the US CDS market this week, especially since Tuesday. Noteworthy that this impacted both IG and HY segments of the market. Not just health insurance companies (UNH) but also hospitals. For instance, in the CDX IG index, CVS is +6 WTD (since Apr 12 close), UNH +7, CAH +9, and in the CDX HY index, THC +50 HCA +10. In the same time, the broader CDX IG was wider by less than a basis point… Today the move extended to medical devices, biotech and pharmaceutical, with PFE +4 (vs CDX unchanged). This relative move in CDS echoes stocks’. Indeed, the sub-index S&P; 500 Health Care Equipment Index has lost -5.2% WTD, while in the same time lapse, the S&P; 500 is almost exactly flat. The main reason is the concerns over Democrats’ ‘Medicare for all’ project, which would expand the US government-administered coverage to most of the population (from the current c60 million people) and potentially squeeze the businesses of not just US health insurers, but also hospitals and the rest of the ecosystem. That offset better than expected earnings from UNH on Tuesday. Indeed, they boosted FY adj EPS guidance mid-point (from $14.50 to $14.75) and they delivered better-than-expected Q1 adj EPS $3.73 vs $3.60 consensus. ‘Medicare for all’ is far from becoming law, but it is undoubtedly supported by some runners for Presidency, obviously on the Democrat side, including the man that President Trump calls ‘Crazy Bernie’.

"All About Control. The 178-year-old travel agent Thomas Cook Group PLC (TCGLN), which owns resorts, travel agencies, tour operators, car hire agencies, and plane/ship fleet, was the clear outperformer today in Euro HY space. This is after Sky reported potential bidders have approached TCGLN about all or part of their businesses. In particular, the HK-based conglomerate Fosun, TCGLN biggest shareholder, has expressed interest. Despite TCGLN having made clear they look to sell their airline part (since FEB), EU law prevents EU-based airlines from being owned by non-EU. Therefore, LHAGR still seems a potential candidate on that arm, although this interest may be partial (that headline popped out post close: *LUFTHANSA INTEREST IN THOMAS COOK IS SAID LIMITED TO LONG-HAUL). But it’s been the airline that performed the best recently, as opposed to the tour-operator. TCGLN 5y CDS is tighter by c240bp, cash jumped 4/4.5%, across € 22s and 23s, and the stock soared c18%. There is potential upside from a change of control at 101 for both the 22s (closed 77) and 23s (closed 67) if a takeover happens. On top of tightening, the CDS curve de-inverted by c145bp in the 1y-5y segment, still decently inverted (more than 300bp) in that portion of the curve. Despite today’s move, we are roughly flat in APR, as last week was reported that anecdotally one of TCGLN bank lenders was unable to sell £25M exposure at 30% discount… Although the M&A; news flow will likely dominate the price action going forward, more colour on the micro developments may come on May 16 H1 results. Beyond those, macro risks such as a potential UK consumer-hitting hard Brexit and the deterioration of relationships between Turkey (big package holiday destination) and the US still remain, without forgetting that last year, it was the unusually warm summer in Europe, and particularly in the UK, which had contributed to take the 5y CDS from c250bp to c1,250bp.
"
"Bond Vigilantes. Argentina (ARGENT) came under pressure today again, with cash wider ('bear flatter') by c60bp/c220bp, 5y CDS wider by c165bp. Month-to-date that leg brings the move to +c350bp. $21s are +220 vs +50 for $ 23s, exacerbating $ cash curve inversion. The CDS curve also flattened (read: inverted more) by -43bp between the 1y and the 5y point. The FX market suffered too (-2.9% vs $) despite being helped by the daily $ sales of Treasury and firm sales of the agro. As not much seems to have changed on fundamentals, liquidity is still very poor and understandably real money actors are not keen to keep Argy risk ahead of October election. This looks like the most binary EM election this year, with pro-market incumbent Macri facing former President & populist Kirchner. Fundamentals are not weaker than it was already today. The fact that CPI came higher than expected last week (4.7% m/m for March) does not bode well, as under painful high-inflation-high-rates conditions, one can be tempted to think that the Argentinian consumer will be more encline to vote for Kirchner. For reference, central government debt has reached 86% GDP including 76% in foreign currency. This year is important as ARGENT will have to pay $81B (principal 64 + interest 17). Then $40B in 2020 (26+14). Gross financing needs expected $50-100B for 2020-23. Outflows have been $16B (17) $19B (18) $2B (19). Since 2016, FDI and financial inflows have amounted to USD8.1bn and USD26.6bn. On the data front, we get trade balance @ 20.00 LDN time. This move was rather local, the rest of credit being rather firm (CDX IG -0.5), helped by strong US IG cash with 10y USTs richer 4bp and SPX breaking 2,940 yesterday. This Argy move triggered a selloff in CDX EM (+9.8bp on 5y s31 today – LDN close), although other constituents are little moved (-2/+3).

"Timing Is King. The Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier Inc. (BOMB) came under pressure today, with cash falling (both the C$2.3B of 7.875 27s and the C$1.4B of 7.5 24s came off 2 points, the former went from 103 to 98.75 in the week), and CDS widening (by c75bp on the 5y – 1s5s steepened by c30bp), thus breaking the ~ 350-400bp post-roll range. This is after BOMB lowered its revenue and profit expectations for 2019. 12m forward revenue is now expected to be c$1B less, while EBITDA may drop below guidance range. Thus driving a higher probability to see net leverage north 2x in the near future. A slower than anticipated acceleration in production on key rail projects and the timing of aircraft deliveries are the official cause for the warning. Basically, it seems that BOMB needs to better synchronize supply with demand. An unfavourable FX translation was also mentioned. Punting on FX is arguably a full-time job. What now, though? The pending operational execution is another risk on the horizon, maybe more an issue for the long end than the short end, as the liquidity position looks OK.  Indeed, 2019 is still expected to be a strong year for FCF, and the short end is unlikely to be too pressured if BOMB closes the year with more than $18B of cash and liquid marketable securities on its balance sheet. We will probably get more colour on the earnings call, scheduled on May 2nd.

"Quality Beat. Ford (F) was the best performing CDS in the CDX IG today, with 5y closing -41bp, a c20% relative move on the spread. That gets us back to the middle of the 5y range, at c170bp, between an early 2018 low of c80bp and an early 2019 wide of c280bp. Cash rallied pretty in line, with 4.35 26s tightening c36bp to swaps. F posted a strong beat overnight with EPS of 44c vs. est. 26c, with an Auto revenue broadly in line ($37.2B vs. est. $37.0B) and an Auto EBIT $300M higher. Region-wise, the auto company cited much better results in North America (although Q1-19 was the weakest quarter for household spending in 5y). The stock was up c10% and the 5y CDS went up to -50bp tighter in LDN trading time. The headline *FORD SAYS U.S. OPENS CRIMINAL PROBE OF EMISSIONS CERTIFICATION came at 1330 LT and stopped the rally, without spurring a reversal. F responded quickly, saying they are cooperating with all US agencies. For reference, they had said in FEB they had been wrong to use road-load specifications to simulate how aerodynamic drag and tire friction can impact fuel consumption. Historically, VW had paid $4.3B in 2017 for misleading regulators/customers about its diesel engines’ emissions. More recently FCAIM recalled 863k vehicles because they violated pollution standards. But F said the potential violations do not involve 'defeat devices' like those used in some VW diesel engines to deliberately cheat US emissions testing. So not enough to worry the credit market at this stage. Still rated BBBn/Baa3n/BBBs, F remains one of the widest names in CDX IG, but went from #1 to #3 in this move, now behind NWL and FD. F’s competitor GM was dragged -15bp, but let’s bear in mind that they will report next Tuesday.

"Atlantic Spread. As political risks don’t seem to be driving the market as much as they did earlier this year (Brexit and other € elections), the focus is seemingly increasing on the US-EU trade after the EC was given the mandate to negotiate tariff cuts on industrial goods. Both the US and the EU are considering tariffs ($11bn and $20bn resp), in connection to a WTO dispute concerning US subsidies to Boeing. A meeting between negotiators has not been fixed yet. It is not clear whether the benefits of a trade deal would be equivalent for both parties, and one might (correctly or not) think that if the US is able to strike a deal with China (widely expected now, Mnuchin adding to the point today), it might look easier with the EU. That said, the tough points of that nego may well be US farm products, where US demands for a comprehensive access have been rejected by the EU. Another factor can be central banks. While the ECB’s line isn’t seen moving in the short term, more focus is likely to build on the Fed, with FOMC this Wednesday. While US Q1 GDP beat is partly one-off (inventories, trade), the economy there is undoubtedly still running above potential as of Q1. A month ago, noise had it that the Fed could cut rates to counter a potential recession, and that rhetoric seems to be shifting, as it becomes evident that the economy is still running above potential. Thus, some members, as Chicago Fed President Evans, seem potentially sympathetic to a cut even if activity pace sustains, if core inflation remains significantly below the 2% target. Evans mentioned 1.5% as a guidance. Such a move could see US IG credit outperform € IG credit, everything else being equal. Again, the fact that we are now pricing 60% of a cut by the end of this year might look counter-intuitive for anyone who’d have been trapped in a block of ice over the past seven months (gardening?), as SPX/Nasdaq are hitting new record highs, and financials conditions indices are back pretty much where we were at the end of SEP (Bloomberg FCI back to +1 GS FCI back to 99.3).
"
"Estonia Still The Big Unkwnown. Danske Bank (DANBNK) CDS was not much changed on day despite stock -9.6%, after it missed in Q1. It’s delivered a -39% YoY decline in net profit, also 15% below Street’s consensus. The main driver of disappointment was the -7% YoY decline in NII. On the margin side of the equation, banking spreads got pressured there due to rate hikes in NOK (from 0.75% to 1.00% in MAR) and SEK (from -0.50% to -0.25% in JAN) while price adjustments have not completely come through. The cost of funding got higher also, due to NPS issuance, along with liquidity costs due to the AML ongoing story. Trading income was also down 9% YoY leaving total income -6% YoY. Costs rose +9% YoY, partly because of higher compliance/AML control efforts... All metrics going the wrong way, that resulted in a Q1-19 RoE down massively to 7.7% from 12.6% in Q1-18. The guidance for this year has been unchanged, DANBNK still sees net DKK14-16bn but this is now including the one-off profit from the sale of Danica Pension Sweden for an amount of cDKK1.3bn. The only good news, if any, is on the volume side of the equation. Indeed, in Sweden/Norway/Finland, DANBNK enjoyed volume growth, leading to a total lending up 1%. And in Denmark, customer base & market share were stable. The CDS was notably less reactive to those results (as opposed to stocks), in contrast with the jumpy price action we had seen due to the Estonian AML thing. On the latter, which is still ongoing, DANBNK repeated it is cooperating with the different authorities & regulators but doesn’t have a clue on the adequate cash flow timeline (times and amounts) …. That being said, it is worth nothing that there was no AML provisions in Q1. The Nordic-exposed bank remains well capitalized as things stand, and it is probably big part of why the credit market was not impressed today. Indeed, FL CET1 is 16.5% vs 14% required vs 16% MT target. 
"
"Final Countdown. Due to Labour day and Golden Week, today was a quiet small-move session for CDS in general. In London time, CDX IG is -0.2 and CDX HY -1.8. Many markets (Japan, China, most continental Europe and many EMs) were closed. And the FOMC has met for 2nd day, decision @ 1900 LDN. Data-wise we got better-than-expected ADP +275k vs. est. 180k (141k to 225k) which was dismissed by markets, and Mfg PMI came in line 52.6 vs 52.4 exp. But ISM Mfg missed, @ 52.8 vs 55 exp. Consequently, Atlanta Fed GDP ticked down from 1.3% to 1.2%. Canada not looking great either despite crude prices. PMI in contraction territory 49.7 (lowest ever – TS starts may2016). In rates space, a US broker I won’t name mentions $15m+ DV01 2yT longs being added over the past week or so by fast money accounts. Seemingly hoping discussions on ‘insurance cuts’ or any noise about 2.5 target. The former looks less unlikely than the latter. The ‘framework-type people’ probably think that the bar is low for the Fed to sound hawkish vs expectation, with a cut priced in by early next year. Trump calling for QE/100bp cut didn’t trigger much reaction either, yesterday. Looking at data, financial conditions and asset prices, the ‘framework-type people’ will probably be tempted to say that the (massive) Fed’s U-turn we saw over the past six months is on the back of an accrued influence by the White House. In the medium term, if that theme gains traction, a risk is that the Fed gets seen as too political/willing to finance the US twin deficits. The potential resulting loss of credibility could then lead to a higher premium into the back end, probably bad for credit and EM spreads. 
"
"Deutsche Qualität. Hum…. VW (Volkswagen) 5y CDS tightened -2 and curve was unchanged vs iTraxx Main +2, in this reasonably risk-off session. It is also important to note that this came in the context of weak auto sales in most markets (VW deliveries in Q1-19 down -3% YoY). This is after VW reported Q1-19 revenues of €60B, +3.1% YoY and above consensus €58B. EBIT (adjusted for -€1B special item arising from legal risks) increased +15.2% YoY to €5B, above consensus €4B. Most brand beat consensus on EBIT margin: VW brand 4.3% vs 4.2%, Audi 8.0% vs 7.4%, Skoda 8.3% vs 7.7%, Scania 11.0% vs 10.8%. Only Porsche missed on that, but margin is still reasonably very high @ 15.7% vs 16.0%. Automotive net liquidity optically dropped to €16B from €24B as of end of Q1-18. €5B jump (down) was due to the first-time application of IFRS16. Despite outflow, FCF was better than expected at €2B. VW has expo to China, but it is managing the slowdown there better than peers, increasing its market share. Going forward, FY-2019 guidance was confirmed (i.e. rev +5% EBIT margin 6.5-7.5%). As far as higher frequency data, April US Light Vehicle sales showed VW +8.7% regaining momentum, vs premium segments lagging (Audi -21.4% Porsche -9.9%). That data is just US and quite volatile. In RV, this beat was the occasion for that BBB+s/A3s/BBB+s credit to tighten back to peers (on 5y CDS: 11.5bp vs F 6bp vs RENAUL & GM 3.5bp vs BMW 2.5bp vs DAIGR). RV outperformance was more vs HY name TTMTIN, where -20% YoY Tata Motors sales helped taking CDS wider +31bp on day.

"With Risk Comes Reward. Next Wednesday (May 8) we will see both national and provincial elections in South Africa (SOAF). Looking at the polls, the ruling ANC seems set to stay in power, but the margin of the victory will matter for markets. At the last election (2014), the ANC got 62% votes. Recent polls have put the ANC between 51% and 61%. But the fact that the latest poll from IRR (serious agency) printed 51%, could be worrying a sign that the ANC victory will be shorter than most people had expected. Two mitigants, here. It is worth noting that the IRR poll was not done face to face, which could increase the share of false responses marginally. It also assumes a 100% mobile phone penetration, which could result in undercounting of vote intentions in the rural areas, where coverage can be bad. And the rural areas happen to be more supportive for the ANC. While this 51% print is not incompatible with a victory in the high-50s (market’s base case, it seems), a too short victory (low-50s) would probably destabilize Ramaphosa within his own party and could make his pro-business & anti-corruption agenda more vulnerable to the populists’ demands. Why? Because the one party that has been rising against ANC is the 2nd most representative, the DA (Democratic Alliance – historically seen as a party for white voters). Thus, a too tight ANC victory would make them constrained to ally with the EFF (Economic Freedom Fighters – left-wing populists, not exactly fiscal hawks) against the DA. Geographically, the interesting province to watch will be the Gauteng (~1/4 of SOAF population, urban/business core with Jo’Burg and Pretoria). The ANC has been declining in the polls in the Gauteng and this might reduce their chances to build a >50% majority in the provincial parliament, which can then increase the probability of a ANC–EFF alliance. Potential causes for public discontent include the sluggish economy, inflation, high unemployment, the power outages (Eskom’s financial & operational troubles would deserve one full Grapple comment). The sovereign 5y SOAF CDS has outperformed its EM peers over the past weeks, it closed @ 188bp today, almost in line with the broader CDX EM 5y s31 (189bp), in which its weight is of 8%. While they were respectively 197bp and 166bp on last roll day close. This RV strength was also in FX, ZAR just -0.7% vs $ over the period while TRY -9.1% ARS -7.9% COP -5.2% BRL -4.1%. This picture makes a ‘tight’ ANC victory look like a low-probability-high-outcome event. With risk comes reward.

"Trade Off. On Monday, London was closed, but elsewhere CDS opened sharply wider on renewed trade concerns after President Trump tweeted on Sunday: “For 10 months, China has been paying Tariffs to the USA of 25% on $50B of High Tech, and 10% on $200B of other goods. These payments are partially responsible for our great economic results. The 10% will go up to 25% on Friday. $325B of additional goods sent to us by China remain untaxed, but will be shortly, at a rate of 25%. The Tariffs paid to the USA have had little impact on product cost, mostly borne by China. The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!”. Yesterday morning, President Trump added: “The US has been losing, for many years, $600B to $800B a year on Trade. With China we lose $500B. Sorry, we’re not going to be doing that anymore!”. The WSJ reported that “President’s warning to China takes Beijing by surprise” and “China Considers Pulling Out of Talks”. Following that, Chinese officials reportedly said that “China shouldn’t negotiate with a gun pointed to its head”. Chinese Vice PM Liu He had reportedly cancelled his trip to Washington DC this week following the tweet. But he will finally go on Thu/Fri. The latter came before iTraxx open and saw S&P; futures regain 15 points, supporting the market in the first part of the session. President Xi had reportedly been encouraging the Chinese delegation to go. One can wonder what has changed on the US side of things, in terms of reaction function. Well interestingly, Axios cited a source familiar with the situation saying that Trump's view is that he is negotiating from a position of strength economically, especially after the latest strong labour report. Thus, as our CDS deltas are based on London closes, it is logical to see trade-related sector underperform vs Friday. Container companies like CMACG (+28) in Europe and KAWKIS (+10) in Japan lagged. Following base metals rout, miners are also underperforming, with European IG miners/base materials wider by ~10bp. AUCHAN was the worst performer in Main (+14), despite relatively solid retail sales as of March, in the Eurozone.

"Smell Of Weather Turning. The oilfield service specialist company Weatherford International Ltd. (WFT) delayed the release to May 10, planning to file its 10-Q for Q1 the same day, and cancelled its earnings call. The stock lost around a fifth of its value, the CDS did not widen (actually a tad tighter on 5y) but the curve aggressively flatter (-960 on 1s5s -360 on 2s5s), on speculations that this release delay may be driven by negotiations with lenders to extend the maturity date on $543M of credit-line commitments that expire this summer (= revolver outst 317 + available in revolvers 226), according to Bloomberg. If those maturity extensions were not granted, the co’s liquidity could become a problem during 2020, a year when they are due $920m, as they had reported $602m of cash and cash equivalents as of FY-2018. Two weeks ago, the board had asked stockholders to approve a 1:20 reverse stock split to prevent the company from being delisted from NYSE. WFT has indeed been trading below $1 since NOV last year, and the NYSE issued a delisting warning in DEC, with a six-month notice. WFT has struggled since oil prices crashed in H2-2014 (stock is -98.4% since SEP-2014), hasn't made money in many years (last profit: Q3-2014 / 2018 net -$2.8B..) which has eroded its financial profile until we reach a point of no-return where crude prices don’t matter anymore (since early FEB, WTI went 54 -> 62, WFT went 0.91 -> 0.38). While management has tried to use assets’ sale to repay debt, that was possibly not enough, as they got around $3.5B due through H1-2021, this week’s release may prove crucial. WFT was in the CDX IG until the s25 (included), therefore s25/s32 -1.3.

"Jaglion. Earlier this year, Peugeot SA (PEUGOT) had been rumoured to have appetite for M&A.; The CEO Carlos Tavares had reportedly the backing of the Peugeot family for it (19 Mar – Les Echos). Back then it was reported that Tavares was seeking a deal that to the company's footprint with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAIM) or Jaguar Land Rover Automotive PLC (TTMTIN) seen as potential candidates. “We supported the Opel project from the start. If another opportunity comes up, we will not be braking, Carlos knows that”.”The Opel operation is an exceptional success, we didn't think that the recovery could be as fast"" said Robert Peugeot. PEUGOT had acquired Opel-Vauxhall from GM in 2017 and has boosted its profitability. The reason that matters is that the Peugeot family is big shareholder (12.2%), along with Bpi France (12.2%) and Dongfeng Motor (12.2%). At the time, FCAIM was seen as the strongest candidate, following the remarks of Manley at the Geneva Auto Show. PEUGOT had effectively approached FCAIM about combining the two companies (22 March – WSJ). Talks had broken down after the Agnelli family rejected any transaction financed with PEUGOT stock and FCAIM was concerned over any greater mature European market exposure. No longer talking. Today, conflicting headlines about a purchase of TTMTIN were a new episode in this M&A; saga, pushing PEUGOT 5y CDS +14 and TTMTIN -50 @ close, after -100 intraday. Press Association reported a sale could be imminent, citing unidentified people at the company. PEUGOT spokesman then said the firm is in “no hurry” to make acquisition and could “stand alone,” adding that if an opportunity comes, co. will consider it. Tata Motors, which owns JLR, denied it was looking to sell its stake. A ""post-sale integration document"" is reportedly in circulation, with companies looking at potential synergies. PEUGOT is currently in appearance insulated from current issues facing the broader autos sector (US tariff threat + Chinese market concerns), as Europe is ~80% of PEUGOT sales. Good news for anyone bullish Europe. Regardless, it leaves PEUGOT as one of the most exposed to upcoming EER (European Emission Regulation). It seems far from its 2021 fleet target of 93g/km. And getting further away. Indeed, its fleet average was 114g/km in 2018. PEUGOT’s reported plans to electrify up to half of its fleet in the next two years (with up to 7 electric model launches this year) and fading SUV success can also pressure margins. As far as TTMTIN is concerned, looking from here, it looks like the market had been to quick to price in defaults, following FQ3 earnings (08 Feb) even as the co was still sitting on £4.4b liquidity incl £2.5b cash. Indeed, at that point, accounts dumped cash in the belly of the curve, in the light of the >£1b of bonds maturing in 2019-2021. Alternative financing options (sale-leaseback agreements, securitization of receivables) were reportedly explored. A posteriori, things didn’t turn that way, and the belly rallied aggressively (5 5/8 23s -380bp), thus outperforming the short (3 ½ 20s in 4%-6%). Still early days for TTMTIN-PEUGOT prospects, Tata Motors (JLR owner since 08, after F) denied for now, looking to extract the most from a deal.
"
"Thyssenkrupp Lifted. A notable mover in iTraxx Xover s31 today was Thyssenkrupp (TKAGR) after Reuters reported that its business split could eventually be abandoned. Indeed, TKAGR is reportedly considering abandoning its split to IPO its elevators business instead, as its joint venture with Tata Steel is expected to fail. Weak steel demand and prices in Europe were probably fatal to the new JV, which would also require approval. The 5y CDS tightened -70bp and the curve flattened. The stock was up 25% on the day, vs +0.3% for the broader SXXP. Markets waited it to be confirmed, which it was around noon, as there had been some opposition to the split as it triggers an upfront c€1b capital gain tax.  The sale will bring cash into the group, although abandoning the steel JV is not necessarily a positive step. The short-term reaction tighter is impressive, although more will probably be needed to take the group from current Ba2n/BB to IG rating. We would probably need to see deeper changes, steel prices rebound, forex headwinds revert, rising raw-material costs fading etc. For reference, TKAGR had proposed last year to split into 2 businesses: Thyssenkrupp Materials and Thyssenkrupp Industrial, the latter being itself split into 3 units (elevator, components technology i.e. automotive supplier and industrial solutions i.e. chemical and cement plant, mining equipment services). That was meant to make the company’s structure leaner, a step for to achieve lower than €300m general and administrative cost, by 2021 fiscal year. Elsewhere, it was a bit of a ‘Sell the Rumour, Buy the Fact’ until late session.  
"
"Escalation. Today the CDX IG widened to more than 65bp as risky assets dropped across the board (even oil after resisting until 2 PM). After Trump’s tone went more hawkish last weekend, the discussions with the Chinese delegation in Washington DC were inconclusive late last week. The US therefore raised tariffs from 10% to 25% on $200B Chinese goods, in the night of Thursday to Friday. Kudlow, who’s always been more on the trade dovish side, calmed things down on Friday, sending risk back up. Big reversal today. Trump tweeted that China should not retaliate, and shortly after that, China announced that they will raise tariffs on 2,943 / $60B US goods from June 1st to 25%. Other goods will see stamp duties of 5-20%. Those will include small aircraft, computers, textiles, chemicals, meat, wheat, wine and LNG and they will exclude oil. CDX IG single name CDS widened by 2bp, in line with the index, with not much dispersion (-1bp/+6bp) despite reports from the Global Times that China may reduce specifically Boeing (BA +1.5) orders and might stop buying US agricultural products. As far as cross-market is concerned, Main/IG traded between 3bp and 4bp, HY slightly decompressed vs IG (+1bp on a 1:4 basis), along with EM (+2bp on a 1:2 basis). As GS highlights, higher tariffs will likely drive up the Fed’s preferred measure of underlying inflation. We might then get an occasion to see whether the Fed is independent and committed to its dual mandate, or aiming at financing the US twin deficits at the lowest possible cost and avoiding equity bear markets. While the latter looks more plausible, the timing and the measures taken will be key to define where risk will rebound.

"Round 3. Ting Ting. . Bayer AG (BAYNGR) has lost the 3rd Glyphosate trial with a jury in California unanimously awarding damages of $2B (punitive damages of $1B each - married couple, both with cancer after using the sadly famous weedkiller Roundup for about 30 years). While the stock was hit up to -5% (close -2% after reaching its lowest level in 7 years) the 5y CDS was just wider by +2bp (vs Main tighter by -2.8bp). In cash space, 3% 21s dipped 25c. In March, the outcome of the 2nd trial had caused +25bp on the 5y CDS, so it is notable that the outcome of this 3rd trial was not in appearance surprising for markets. But the amount of damages awarded is significantly higher than witnessed in the previous cases ($80M for both). It is worth noting that BAYNGR has previously seen a Californian court award $289M against them, although this figure was later reduced to $78M on appeal, so there is potential for downside on this $2B. BAYNGR’s approach is now to contest and appeal all cases, they probably hope that appeals can give a different verdict/compensation amount as they are decided by a judge and not by a jury. There are 4 more cases pending this year and the appeal decision will be towards the end of the year, in particular the upcoming Hall vs. Monsanto trial (June 3rd – will be the first one out of California). On the stock, a DCF & SOTP valuation range implies more than €30B legal risk. On the CDS, at 100bp, the spread is reflecting downgrades, from the current BBB s /Baa1 n, as the German name is now wider than some IG names rated BBB-/Baa3, on the brink of junk. Separately, BAYNGR has announced the sale of Coppertone to Beiersdorf for a purchase price of $550M, which is expected to close in Q3-2019. Coppertone brand’s sales last year were about $213M, so that’s on a 2.6x multiple, quite close to the expectation. So this arguably didn’t move the price much. The other consumer brand Dr Scholl’s could also be divested for 2.6x sales. Other potential catalysts include US/China trade tensions and French dossier revelations, the former having been the main macro price action driver over the past sessions. Elsewhere, the market reverted from yesterday’s risk-off session, with iTraxx Main tighter -2.8bp, Xover -9.3bp.

"Roaring. Autos have outperformed the broader market lately. Today F -9 GM -3 in the US, FRFP DAIGR BMW VW are -1/-3. In stocks space, Faurecia +5% BMW +3% DAI +3% are also amongst best performers. This contrasts with 2018, where trade tensions were most often coupled with Autos/Auto parts underperformance. Indeed, finished vehicles were not in the list of the goods China will add tariffs on. They are currently at 15% and won’t get to 40%, as of now. Within the auto sector, US tire companies (CTBUS, GT) underperformed as they will see Chinese tariffs hiked from 5% to 10%. On May 9, Reuters had reported automakers expect Trump to delay 18 May by up to 6m. 90-day deadline was indeed reported to be a soft one. Today’s headlines echoed that, adding a little bit of outperformance. That comes after a mixed earning season for German autos. Earlier this month, BMW had reported a surprisingly resilient q1, excl. the impact of bigger than expected provision (€1.4b vs €1.1b cons). Auto EBIT came €1,090m ~ cons. But Group EBIT came €1,989m vs cons €1,753m with Motos/FS beating. In Apr, DAIGR had had a weaker q1, EBIT €2,084m (excl. €718m one-off) vs cons €2,246m. Big vehicles drove the miss @ DAIGR. Van (-€98m EBIT vs cons +€110m) along with Bus (-€21m EBIT vs consensus -€5m) divisions. FCF -€2b vs +€2b in 18 also - same as BMW - due to inventory build. On the other side of the Atlantic, as I commented previously in this blog, Ford (F) enjoyed a nice q1 beat. CDS -41bp intraday, after EPS came 44c vs cons 26c with Auto rev in line ($37.2b vs cons $37.0b) and Auto EBIT $300m higher. Those + news being mentioned, it is worth noting that headlines today reported a delay (up to 6m), not an outright cancellation of auto tariffs. PEUGOT clearly the underperformer over the past month, as reports of M&A; talks with JLR picked up. Although those have been denied by Tata and PSA. No smoke without fire (?)

"Widen Your World. Thomas Cook Group PLC (TCGLN) credit swap jumped to 52% intra day before reverting to high-40s on the 5y. In cash, the €750m 2022s fell -17c before retracing +3c, after the company results as of end of March19. H1 adjusted EBIT came at -£245m. Net debt jumped +40%y @ £1.3b from £0.9b. TCG effectively tapped £0.6b from its existing revolver. They made a £1.1b goodwill impairment on their UK business relating to 2007 m&a.; Liquidity-wise, they said they will get a £0.3b rescue loan – contingent to making progress on selling their airline (9 months: Oct19-Jun20, secured so potentially less assets for other creditors if insolvency). So basically, there will be no sure new funding by then… There were reportedly multiple bids for airline. LHA, Virgin, Ryanair were mentioned as potential bidders. The share of TCGLN is at the lowest since 2012, so market cap is now just £0.3b... Contrasting with peer TUI, H2 profit outlook looks dull. Bookings for coming summer are -12%y. Airline bookings -6%y. Recent uncertainty bolstered promotional activity, higher fuel prices still weigh on margins and Brexit process can make some UKs delay their holidays. Plus, TCGLN noted weakness in key North Europe market due to a ‘backlash against air travel’ (which I find surprising given the relative proportion of sea/bridges in that part of the world...). US-Turkey tensions could also weigh on sentiment, given that Turkey is a big package holiday destination. Today an official said the delivery of Russian missile system S-400 is going on according to the planned timeline. No change there. Nevertheless, noise around M&A; talks (for the airliner arm) is probably going to dominate price action in the coming weeks, as it was the case on last April 23rd, when I last commented on TCGLN, in DataGrapple.

"Expectation Managed. Suedzuecker AG (noted SZUGR) 5y CDS has tightened c30bp over the past month, now back below 150bp. I last commented the name in this blog last March 28, as it performed very poorly following the roll. Indeed, the company had announced a profit warning ahead of its 2018-19 FY results. Back then, the German sugar maker expected revenues €6.75b & EBITDA €350m, mainly because of the sugar segment. And today, SZUGR reported its results in line with its previous warning. Revenues €6.75b EBITDA €353m. The EBITDA is thus down -53% YoY. The earning drop was driven by the sugar segment. Cashflow-wise, FCF -€290m left Net Debt €1.1b (from €0.8b a year before) and leverage 6.7x (from 2.4x). Guidance was little changed also: revenues €6.7-7.0b EBIT €0-€100m. Rating-wise, SZUGR is still IG (Baa3n/BBB-n) with negative outlooks, and a recovery in sugar prices looks like the only way SZUGR doesn’t get downgraded from here. Beyond that, its 6.7x leverage is unlikely to fall below the agencies thresholds until 2020-21, which is when the improvement in sugar prices could have taken effect. That makes management’s commitment to IG rating debatable.

"Unity vs Strength. Argentine Republic (ARGENT) CDS was the main mover in the CDX EM over the past few weeks, as the risk premium linked to October’s vote came higher. Former president and populist Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (CFK) surprised by announcing that she asked Fernández to run for president, her being running for VP. Local paper La Nación reported that CFK offered Fernández to run for president on May 15, he then accepted on May 16. Out of its context, it could have looked positive for ARGENT risk, as her probability to win the vote is probably to be blamed for most of the risk premium built in over the past few weeks. However, at the open, ARGENT CDS came wider by +30bp and $ cash opened lower. Because CFK’s move is clearly a strategy to broaden her political space, offering an 'argument' to some Peronists that are not in her camp to join, which is rightly seen as boosting chances to get a populist-governed Argentina (again). Fernández had been chief of cabinet during both Nestor Kirchner's and CFK’s presidencies. Although he had then become critic of CFK, they now share the objective of beating Macri. 30bp isn’t much, when it is about ARGENT CDS, and the 5y even reverted to flat on this session (based on London close). Peronists governors Urtubey & Schiaretti have said it does not change things, and they do not back AF-CFK. Massa was more supportive, but that was expected. Net net, no big change. It is arguable that although the market is unchanged, the distribution of outcomes is probably different, given that it is possible to win in the 1st round with <50% votes (by getting either 45%+ of the votes, or 40%+ and have a 10% gap over 2nd). Other CDX EM constituents are also little changed -2.5 (Turkey) / +2 (Colombia) despite decent spot FX moves (TRY/$ +0.5% COP/$ -1.7%).
"
"Unchanged. That title could have suited well for a Brexit update, although ‘update’ implicitly suggests that something has changed. Jaguar Land Rover Automotive PLC (TTMTIN) reported q4 (talking fiscal year) revenues £7.1b so down a decent -6% YoY, with retail sales themselves down -8% YoY. The 5y CDS was little changed (+5bp on the day), as this was arguably quite in line with the market’s expectations. Similarly, EBITDA came at £696m, so down -24% YoY. The weak Chinese performance is the main factor to be blamed on these results.  TTMTIN JV’s EBITDA margin printed at 5.4% this q4 vs 37.7% the q4 of last fiscal year. Can be called a squeeze. FCF came okay, at £1.4b, from £949m. It was optically pushed by working capital lower capital expenditure. Liquidity still looks solid for now, at £5.7b. Reported leverage is still north the target, at 2.3x. No real surprise on the guidance, although those are bad news. EBIT margin guided 3-4% with FCF improving. EBIT margin target still 7-9%. Leverage target still =2.0x. But management now expects to hit them in 2023 fiscal year. Delayed one year. Going forward, the focus will likely be on 1/ China-US relationships, 2/ potential M&A; noise and 3/ Brexit. We are a tad below 600bp on the 5y vs a tad above 900bp back in February, on the occasion of the previous quarterly earning report.

"All Eyes On Retail. Casino (COFP) went under pressure today, with its 5y CDS wider by c80bp, while XOver s31 fair value was up by ‘only’ 4bp. The CDS closed at its widest level ever, 710bp mid context. The curve flattened some c35bp between the 1y point and the 5y point. Firstly, the French news paper Le Figaro reported that the offices of COFP have been raided by the EC and the French police, along with Intermarche owner Les Mousquetaires. This is due to a joint buying alliance INCAA with Intermarche which was dissolved last summer. The EC then said that its officials carried out unannounced inspections in the offices of French retailers on Monday, saying it has concerns that 2 retailers “may have violated EU antitrust rules that prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices”. CO FP stocks went under pressure also, down -6.5% in mid London PM before bouncing back in late session. Closed -3.5%. Worth remembering that these stocks are collateral to loans contracted by the mother company Rallye (RALFP), whose CDS is wider also, closing north 45% today. The fact that a sell-side analyst downgraded the name overnight didn’t help, as it was the case by the past. Also noteworthy that COFP has similar alliances with both AUCHAN (CDS just wider +2, in line with iTraxx Main - called ‘Horizon’), one with MEOGR also. Across the channel, Marks and Spencer PLC (MARSPE) was also under pressure, but to a lesser extent, 5y CDS +13bp. The Baa3/BBB- name saw net debt reduced (£1.5b and thus leverage is down to 3.0x from 3.1x) and FCF still robust (£584m), but as far as growth is concerned, LFL sales went down -1.6%. Going forward, the rights issue and dividend move to finance the Ocado joint venture show that creditors could hope to see more growth, in a credit-friendly manner. The retail sector was also topical in the US today. Indeed, Nordstrom (JWN) was the worst performing CDS in CDX IG. CDS is wider +21bp and the 3s5s is steeper about +15bp, as they cut their guidance.  This was due to changes to loyalty program and merchandising misses which took sales down for the 2nd quarter in a row.
"
"Asymmetry?. Credit indices have been very well behaved over the last few months, and they have frustrated some of the most aggressive investors who were looking for volatility. In that respect, equities have provided much more fun. But what held for credit indices and for most of their constituents was not true for the whole credit market, and CDS had the opportunity to show their brutal nature in a few instances. Once a name has reached tipping point, CDS become very asymmetrical instruments and risk premia tend to increase dramatically over very short periods of time.  Since the beginning of May, that was the case for TCGLN ( Volvo AB ). Its risk premium skyrocketed roughly 25pts upfront (to insure $1 of debt for 5 years you had to $0.25 upfront and then $0.05 per year during 5 years) to 64pts upfront today. During today’s session alone RALFP ( Rallye ) saw its risk premium jumped 15pts from 45pts to 60pts upfront after the stock was suspended pending a company announcement. Market participants were also reminded that selling short dated protection can prove a dangerous game. When WFT (Weatherford International) said they would file for bankruptcy protection, while its 5-year risk premium hardly moved as this outcome was largely anticipated at some stage, its 1-year risk premium went overnight from 25pts to 45pts upfront.

"#3 Global. Despite Mercedes’ triumph in Monte Carlo this weekend, I will not discuss it here, as firstly it has no implication for the CDS and secondly the title wouldn’t have been ‘#3’. Reversely, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (ticker: FCAIM) was the best performing single-name CDS in iTraxx Xover today, with 5y CDS tighter by c28bp (since Fri close), while both the index and its fair value went wider by c2bp. FCAIM delivered a non-binding letter to the Board of Renault (ticker: RENAUL) proposing a combination of their respective businesses as a 50/50 merger of equals (equity split, with FCAIM shareholders to get €2.5b to compensate for the difference in market caps). From a credit point of view, no new debt seems needed to finance the deal and the base case is that existing bonds would stay in their boxes, if the deal goes through. There has not been any report of cross-default either, thus far. The RENAUL board reportedly responded that it would study the proposal ‘with interest’ and other reports then acknowledged that RENAUL would answer by the end of next week. From a strategy standpoint, brand portfolios appear complementary (covering a rather wide quality spectrum, from Lada/Dacia to Maserati/Alfa-Romeo). The two groups look geographically complementary as well (indeed RENAUL enjoys a strong footprint in Europe & CEEMEA whereas FCAIM is stronger in Americas for example) Net net, the deal would create a big big player, as proforma combined entity would be #3 globally (in particular, it would be #2 in EMEA, #1 in LATAM). From an economic standpoint. The synergy potential seems big on the paper (€5b per annum from year 6 thanks to platform convergence, consolidation of powertrain and electrification investments + economies of scale). Synergy-wise, no plant closure/layoff has been floated yet. It is not clear what rating the proforma would have, given that this is a IG-HY merger. The statement mentions “strong combined b/s allowing for flexible capital allocation and robust dividend policy”, which could suggest that the aim for the combined entity would be IG. Still to be seen, as the sector has challenges ahead of it, and agencies know it. As usual, the comments I post on this site do not have vocation to take a stance, but here are some potential factors which might play out to reverse the price action we saw today. The EC still has to be okay, from an antitrust standpoint, especially with regard to FCAIM- RENAUL big size (would be #3 player globally). As far as shareholders, with RENAUL and FCAIM respective stocks both up +13% and +7% since Friday close, we are unlikely to see strong opposition from them. That said, Nissan stock is just up 2%. Despite the fact that the FCAIM statement was strongly in favour of closer ties with Nissan (ticker: NSANY / €1b synergies), NSANY’s position within the RENAUL- NSANY alliance would automatically shrink. As far as states are concerned, the French and Italian governments seem supportive. I often commented autos’ potential M&As; in this blog, and as a follow-up on May 9th note, it now seems that the higher the odds of FCAIM- RENAUL, the higher the odds of Peugeot-Jaguar LR.

"Alignment Of Interest. Casino Guichard-Perrachon (COFP) is now Ba3 n/Bn after S&P; downgraded the credit by 2 notches, after the mother company Rallye (RALFP) started safeguard proceedings. Post that, the 5y CDS is wider by 35bp, after a +60bp delta intra-day. More importantly, the curve flattened aggressively, with 1s5s down by more than -100bp. The DC confirmed a credit event had occurred on Rallye (RALFP) for both docs, in this respect. Debtwire reported that a bank has been trying to sell €100M RALFP secured, suggesting the value attached to the security package (COFP shares) may not be worth as much. S&P; said COFP CEO Naouri may not have his interest aligned with COFP creditors’, as he got COFP stocks as collateral of RALFP, he has interest to maximize dividend payments to service RALFP's debt and receive dividends on behalf of RALFP rather than deleverage COFP. The safeguard procedure may be a way for RALFP shareholders to avoid the enforcement of the pledge over their shares in COFP that are collateral for RALFP creditors (banks), keeping their control on COFP. The fact that COFP cancelled its 2019 interim dividend (normally paid Nov) was a slight positive, but was not unexpected, and didn’t prevent the selloff. And COFP has not changed its dividend per share policy, for now, making this look more like a one-off. And as that came just after the downgrade, some other negative developments might be under way. 
"
"Less Is More. The Marseille-based shipping giant CMA CGM (ticker: CMACG, #4 global) underperformed the euro high yield CDS complex, with the 5y wider by 166bp, despite revenue growth. Q1 revenue came +37% YOY. That was helped by volume carried up by +4% YOY and higher revenue/container ratios, despite fleet capacity actually rose by +7% YOY. The efforts are poised to continue on the expense side of the income statement, with cost savings program increased from $1.2B to $1.5B. CMACG said it has already cut $245M in costs via rationalization of some its services, new supplier relationships, energy-reducing efforts and other operational efficiencies. Nevertheless, for the time being, CMACG posted a net loss of -$43M, while it had lost -$77M over Q1-2018. With EBITDA of $780M and net debt of $18B (just half of it if you exclude leases / the acquisition of CEVA effectively added $2.8B debt), leverage is actually a tad below 7x. Liquidity-wise, CMACG has roughly $2B, with cash on balance sheet standing at $1.7B plus they have $0.4B of undrawn facilities. The context of trade tensions still weighs on sentiment toward container shipping companies. The US and China have failed to make a deal and EU-US talks have not advanced. EU trade commissioner Malmstrom said she does not think the US is ready to start on the tariff negotiations. Nevertheless, CMACG expects to see further growth in its volumes this year, “regardless of the geopolitical climate” (CFO) as increasing activity from South East Asia towards the US. It is fair that the traffic between the US and South East Asia (China) could temporarily pick up, partly due to US importers anticipating further tariffs, which is what had boiled CMACG’s activity in the second half of last year.
"
"Tequila Sunrise. Mexican risk got under unusual pressure during this session (CDS +15 FX -3.5%). Trade tensions escalated further with President Trump (is it useful to say, unexpectedly) imposing a 5% tariff on all Mexican goods. Allegedly to counter illegal migrants from the country. Those will be increased in phases until the immigration issue is remedied. Value date is June 10 and tariffs will be increased by +5% each month until it reaches 25%, basically (could be by October). Unless or until the flow of illegal immigrants across the border stopped. And at that point, tariffs will be removed. In corporate space, US autos were hit hard. Light vehicle exports from Mexico to the US total ~2.4 million units per year. And ~400k units would seemingly be at risk in the worst case (25%). Still on the trade topic, US/China tensions continue with China retaliating to the Huawei move with an unreliable entity list. Trade uncertainty is still weighing in the data, with China NBS manufacturing PMI 49.4 in May (Bloomie estimate was 49.9). Forward-looking metrics (new orders) also contracted, reflecting slowing demand and cautiousness from businesses. China CDS is +2.5 on day, close to 60bp. Headlines that ex-PBOC governor said 7.00 in $CNH was not threshold hasn’t helped risk. SOAF CDS followed suit, after the main focus was on the cabinet. Ramaphosa announced a leaner cabinet including Mboweni (finance minister) and Gordhan (SOEs i.e. public enterprises). It should follow global risk, waiting for the president’s June 20 speech. Over the past 3 years, SOAF had 2 technical recessions. Consensus for 2019 seems +1%, but it is possible to see current account deficit widen to -3% GDP from -2.2% in Q4. 
"
"Refi. The cinema operator Vue International Bidco Plc (VUECIN) saw its 5-year senior CDS tighten by c160bp, making it the best performer in iTraxx CrossOver, following the release of the new financing package of term loans. A total of c£800m financing was announced via Bidco entity. That is more than what is needed to fully refinance VUECIN existing (incl. £362m 2020s outst). The increasing of maturities and the reducing of cost of debt will give VUECIN more flexibility, going forward. As per company communique, this package will include c£550m-equivalent EUR Senior Secured Term Loan B, c£98m EUR Senior Secured Term Loan B and £165m 2nd Lien PIK Notes provided by OMERS, a current VUECIN shareholder. Not much impact on the short bond (July 2020s) which are up just 10c on the day. At close to 300bp, the 5y is at its tightest level YTD, and this move unwinds the Dec 6th refi-linked bearish move on the name.  Elsewhere, we saw Europe outperform in this session, after opening close to the wides.

"Bulls And Bears Make Money, …. Read ‘credit bulls’ and ‘rates bears’. Risk was on today, as some FOMC members have signaled some openness to rate cuts. That’s not the case of Clarida (was on the wires half an hour ago, refusing to touch on a potential June rate cut while the meeting is in two weeks..) and Williams, but mainly Bullard yesterday raised the prospects of such an option. In the short end, that took 1y1y $ OIS more than 125bp from November, before stronger risk made it reverse a tad today. Evans indeed sounded less dovish than Bullard and Powell didn’t explicit mean to cut, which kind of leaves the door open. Data-wise, we get the employment report on Friday, inflation on next Wednesday. The prospects of potentially more rates cuts in the US were probably the main factor pushing risk higher, starting with equities as the S&P; 500 is up by almost 2% here. Speaking about our world, all the 10 on-the-run CDS indices came tighter on the day, with Europe performing broadly in line with the US. In particular in IG world, the 5y Main-CDX IG spread held stable between 0 and 1bp, coming from 3bp a few days ago. Sector-wise, miners were amongst outperformers (MTNA -13bp GLENLN -10bp AALLN -9.5bp), along with retail (AUCHAN -18bp COFP -30bp FD -14bp JWN -11.5bp KSS -9bp), autos (F -12.5 GM -9bp / London closes) and the 5y SeniorFinancial-Main spread tightened to 16.5bp, coming from 21bp a few days back. EM performed particularly strongly. Mexican officials said they expect to avoid Trump administration tariffs. Lower rates in the US also supportive of that space, especially names such as Argentina (-38bp, London close) and Turkey (-17bp).
"
"Crude. Black gold came under pressure today. WTI came down more than 4%. Now back at the lowest level since January. The move down accelerated after the DOE release. Total petroleum stockpiles surged by the most on record in data going back to 1990 last week, according to the EIA. That was due to a combination of higher imports, lower seasonal demand and a rise in local supply. As far as the latter, it has been multiplied by 2.4x over the past decade. We could feel the impact of that move, in both CDX and single name CDS spaces. As far as the latter, oil-related names underperformed in both IG (ECACN +5.5 DVN +3.5 APA +3 VLO +2.5 CNQCN +2 HES +2 vs CDX IG fair value -1.2) and HY (WFT aside, CHK +75 RIG +64  NBR +46 vs CDX HY fair value -0.6). As far as the former, CDX HY decompressed vs CDX IG by almost 4bp, looking at the relative value on a 1:4 basis. Most of the names cited above in the US saw their <5y CDS curves steepen, in this move led by the 5y point. In sovereign CDS space, this crude move had no impact. Fiscally oil-dependent countries such as Malaysia, Colombia are just wider by 1bp. Along with Brazil. Mexico is unchanged. Indonesia and Russia are tighter by -1bp and -2.5bp, respectively. 
"
"The Bar Was High. The expectations of market participants were high, ahead of this GC. Draghi only had 4 meetings left and the fact that € HICP 5y5y came back to the 2016 lows wasn’t enough for the ECB to announce that its ready to step in (QE/rates). That measure is indeed around 1 ¼. Close to the lowest level ever. But maybe spot data paradoxically matters more. While a central bank should be forward-looking by definition, it was the negative inflation print in early 2015 which had arguably weighed much for the GC to launch QE. I think that in absolute, the GC was still dovish today, as rate hike guidance has been pushed back (by 6 months) to the end of H1-2020, and even explicitly opened the door to the next move being a cut. But that wasn’t enough, taking stocks lower, €$ higher and spreads wider. Itraxx Main backed up 2.5bp, senior Fin 5bp and Xo/Sub financial 9-10bp. In relative value terms sector-wise, SnrFin/Main rebounded to 17 ½ after dipping to close to 15 before the release. That echoed the move seen in stoxx benchmarks, with SX7E plunging 3.8% from 1300 to 1530. During the same time SX5E gave -1.2% and SXXP -0.9%. This is as we learnt about the TLTRO3 pricing. The cost for banks will be between 10bp and -30bp. Here the GC tried to be a tad more dovish than the consensus, which was seemingly more at -25bp. In sovereign space, peripheral spreads came wider. The 10-year BTP/Bund spread traded in mid-260s this AM before picking up to mid-270s and closed 273bp. 10y Bunds closed -24bp to the richest level ever. As inflation expectation market-based measures got hit, yield curves flattened, starting with Germany (-6bp in 2s30s), prolonging to the US (-3bp in 2s30s).
"
"Tequila Sunset. Fridays follow one another but don't look alike… Last Friday, I commented on Mexico risk hit after President Trump came out with a 5% tariff on all Mexican goods to counter illegal migrants, potentially incrementally increased by +5% steps all the way up to 25%. Today, President Trump said that there is a good chance that the US will make a deal with Mexico: “If we are able to make the deal with Mexico, & there is a good chance that we will, they will begin purchasing Farm & Agricultural products at very high levels, starting immediately.” Net net, Mexico CDS is little changed (+3 bps) over the past week. Trade is indeed not the only factor in the equation. The giant PEMEX saw its CDS widen +27.5bp (vs sovereign +5bp) today, after Fitch downgraded it by one notch to junk (BB+). The market's move shows Fitch isn’t expected to be the only agency to downgrade the name. Another downgrade from either S&P; or Moody’s would take PEMEX bonds out of indices, leading to a forced sell-off from IG-only investors. Pemex's EBITDA had fell -14% YoY in Q1-2019 to $6B, despite the fact that oil was roughly flat. The main driver was a decline by -12% YoY of the production. Liquidity was tightening, meanwhile, with cash -18% YoY to $3.4B, vs an amount of undrawn credit available under $6.5B + MXN 32.5B bank lines declined to 2.6 + 25.5 vs 6.4 +26.2 in Q4-2018. A $8B sovereign funding still has to materialize, also. As far as local economic data is concerned, the CPI came down -0.3% MoM in May, core inflation stood at +0.2% MoM. That was mainly driven by the +0.3% MoM move in merchandise prices, adding to increases in food, beverages and tobacco.

"Dust to Dust. Fiat (FCAIM) and Renault (RENAUL) are reportedly looking for ways to revive merger plans. In particular, they need to get Nissan (NSANY) green light, according to Reuters. The respective chairmen reportedly talked about reviving the plan and are apparently still enthusiastic about a megadeal. Within the existing alliance, NSANY reportedly asks RENAUL to reduce its stake in it, in exchange for supporting a combination with FCAIM. FCAIM has also reportedly floated the idea of a call option that would allow NSANY to increase its 7.5% stake in the combined proforma FCAIM-RENAUL. Meanwhile, the French government has also showed some signs of willingness to reduce its stake in RENAUL (“we can reduce the state’s stake in Renault’s capital. This is not a problem as long as, at the end of the process, we have a more solid auto sector and a more solid alliance between the two great car manufacturers Nissan and Renault”, MOF Le Maire) before saying that it was not as urgent as to strengthen the existing alliance RENAUL-NSANY. According to the FT, RENAUL has told NSANY that it will block the company’s plan to overhaul its corporate governance. RENAUL chairman wrote to NSANY CEO that RENAUL had decided to abstain from the AGM vote, thus denying the proposal for which 2/3 votes are required. NSANY said that it thought that RENAUL stance on the matter was regrettable, in what looks more and more like a tit-for-tat game. It is not clear how NSANY will react, but it feels like the prospect of a RENAUL-NSANY merger is completely removed and if anything the complete opposite may be more likely, especially if it can help RENAUL to push through a deal with FCAIM. As far as our world is concerned, the respective CDS didn’t move much today. Indeed, we see both names tighter by 3bp or so, against a very risk-on backdrop that saw the Main tighten more than 2bp and the Crossover by more than 9bp. 
"
"Neiman Moment. Neiman Marcus Group LLC (NMG) is a department store chain offering mostly prime fashion stuff. It is also one of the widest names in the CDX HY index, paying around 55%. Today its results came not far from expectations. Net sales came up +9.2%y and beat estimate, with gross margin stable 35%. Adjusted EBITDA down -12% y. The area of growth was MyTheresa (revenue +23.6%y). It will be included in consolidated balance sheet and p&l; statement going forward. That is the innovative/online arm, which can impact customers globally, and aimed specifically at younger customers, but also mostly positioned on women luxury fashion. The company reported a net loss of -$88M vs +$326M same period previous year. That EBITDA is to put in regard with (i) secured debt $3.4B (ii) total debt $5B and cash thin less than $40M. So net net, leverage is 7.5x on secured 11x on total basis. The credit markets seemed not too surprised by the release, with CDS (5y) still paying around 55% (mid) on our London close. Cash-wise, term loans 1L 7 1/8 28s ~ 80 2L 8 24s ~ 90 3L 8 24s ~45 and unsecured 8 21s ~ 60.

"Miguel Ángel. Emerging market risk looked rather firm, as a whole, with the benchmark CDX EM s31 tightening 3bp on the day (London close), not far below 96 cents on the dollar, with Argentina (6% of the on-the-run index) the main mover. Argy rally effectively happened last night after our close, triggered by Macri picking Senator Pichetto (PJ) as his Vice-President. The latter was the leader of the opposition Peronist caucus in the Senate and a member of the Alternativa Federal group of Peronists who have, in the past, dissented against Mrs Kirchner. In his own camp, members of Cambiemos expressed support. Markets took that positively as it could broaden Macri’s spectrum, and although Pichetto does not sound like a super popular politician (i.e. he is not expected to directly add many many votes), that latest tactical move might drag other Peronists to the Macri’s camp in the future (Mr Urtubey will be key to watch, in particular). Across other asset classes, the Merval index gained more than 6% and ARS/$ came up more than 2.5%. The prospects of dovish Fed have also been supportive of Argentina lately. No later than this PM, the dollar also came weaker on the back of lighter than expected inflation data.

"Black and Yellow. The Hertz Corporation (HTZ) outperformed US HY CDS space today, with 5y point tighter by c120bp, now c525bp on our European (well, British) close. That is after HTZ disclosed (unexpected) that on June 26, it will distribute to shareholders subscription rights to buy up to 57.92m new shares or c$750m, in a rights offering. Plans to use the proceeds of this rights offering to deleverage its balance sheet (basically repay the senior notes, both 20s and 21s) boosted the CDS. It looks good, because it should lower future interest expense and cut leverage while limiting dilution among existing shareholders, in particular Icahn (29% ownership) intends to participate to the offering. On top of the rights offering, HTZ cited a very strong Q2 and guides c$2.5B revenues $165-185M EBITDA (consensus was $131M). So leverage should arrive close to 6x, assuming $750m debt paydown and EBITDA of $175M (mid-point of guidance). Still not quite the 4x management’s target. HTZ debt average maturity is close to 3years, with 2021 and 2022 the biggest years, altogether more than 2/3 of total debt ($5.4B). From an M&A; standpoint, earlier this week, Macquarie Research interestingly noted that a potential deal between HTZ and Avis (CAR) looks possible due to lower antitrust (DOJ) risk, after companies like Uber/Lyft have gained market share. That phenomenon leaves HTZ CAR market shares to high single-digit from low 20s.

"Pivot. A resolution in US/Mexico trade tensions offered some respite to CDS across regions in the first half of the week. Both US and European IG indices rallied around 4bp, CrossOver 15bp and CDX HY 20bp. That proved temporary, however, as a core rates rally picked up steam, pushing G3 yields to fresh lows. The sacrosanct Bund yield came to -27bp this AM, lowest level ever. We retraced this afternoon, to some extent, after US retail sales data showed that the US consumer is still strong (higher than expected results for the core and control group readings, along with higher revisions in April). As less than 20% is priced in for next week’s FOMC meeting (June 19), market participants will try, on the occasion of next week’s meeting, to figure out about the subsequent meetings, starting with July 31 (86% priced in). There are about three 25bp cuts priced in the $ OIS curve by March 2020. That is to compare with c10bp priced in the short end of the €/JPY OIS curves. This week, a major European bank called for an ECB rate cut at the September 12 meeting, which is scheduled to be the penultimate meeting for President Draghi (last one being October 24). Next week could prove pivotal in this respect, with CPIs being release in the Eurozone, the UK, Canada and Central Banks meetings being scheduled in the US, the UK, and Japan.

"Guidance Lowered. Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHAGR) has lowered its full-year guidance last night and made a provision for tax risk. Its shares plunged by c13% intraday, which was the worst selloff in 3y and in credit, the 5y CDS widened by 6.5bp, making it the worst performing name in the iTraxx Main s31 index. Currently rated BBB/Baa3, it is now more clearly the ‘wider’ half of the Main s31. The guidance revision was due to pricing deterioration in Europe, mainly caused by 1/ overcapacities 2/ low-costers’ fierce competition. The European short-haul market is the most impacted by the low-costers, with the long-haul market performing better. Across brands, Network Airlines are expected to get EBIT margin 7-9% (from 7.5-9.5%) Eurowings -4%/-6% (from c0%). Net net, LHAGR EBIT margin is guided 5.5-6.5% (from 6.5-8.0%). Adding to that guidance revision, LHAGR will also make a provision for a tax risk of €340M in its H1-19 accounts, because the Supreme Tax Court changed the case law established in prior years. The capital markets day on next Monday (Jun 24) will surely be interesting to watch for more color.

"ECB 1-0 FED. Today was marked by an aggressive broad-based rally in risky assets. Our beloved credit synthetics were no exception, with Europe leading the way. The Main s31 rallied more than 4bp, tightening c2bp relative to CDX IG s32. Reportedly positioning (short Europe vs US) may well help us see lower levels in that ‘Atlantic spread’. Draghi indeed lifted risk this morning, saying that if the outlook doesn’t improve, additional stimulus will be needed. Stimulus can take many aspects and the ECB toolbox is big. Later in the session, as talks about restarting QE gained traction, ECB sources headlines (coincidentally) hit us stating that a rate cut was the most likely vector of easing. Draghi himself had (also coincidentally) stressed that further interest cuts remain part of ECB tools. Because good news often come in pairs, President Trump tweeted: ""Had a very good telephone conversation with President Xi of China. We will be having an extended meeting next week at the G-20 in Japan. Our respective teams will begin talks prior to our meeting."" No need to say that the upcoming G20 meeting (Jun 28-29) is the next meaningful catalyst for US/China trade tensions. That positive development contrasts with Commerce Secretary Ross playing down hopes for some time. In a less friendly register, President Trump linked Draghi’s dovish rhetoric to currency and stocks (‘DAX’) manipulation. No need to say, the big one tomorrow is gonna be the Fed. Some US banks’ economists expect the Fed not to cut at all in 2019, vs 3+ cuts priced in by March. We may well hit some golden mean between the two. Looking at an aggregate ECB forecast from € banks in 2017, depo rate should have reached between 0.5% and 1% by now… Back to reality, the € short end is pricing in one 10-bp cut by EOY-19 and another half through H1-20.
"
"Side Effect. DISH DBS Corp (DISH) was the worst performing name in US HY space today, wider by c50bp on the 5y contract, now close to c500bp. This is as reports came yesterday post London close that DISH is actually in talks to pay at least $6B for assets that T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS) and Sprint Corp. (S) are unloading to get the regulatory approval for their merger. In the same time, TMUS is about unchanged and S is 13bp tighter on the 5y. What is at stake is that the US wants to at least 4 wireless competitors, to avoid anti-competition... Cash-wise, DISH‘s bonds are also among the worst performers in US HY. Indeed, the $2B 5.875% 24s are down ~65c and the $2B 7.75% 26s lost about 1.25 point. As a second-order effect, Bloomberg intelligence wrote in a note that if the Department of Justice requires spectrum asset sales to Dish as part of the T-Mobile-Sprint approval, it would decrease the chances of the FCC denying DISH a renewal of its expiring wireless licenses in 2020. DISH still must meet the buildout requirements for use of that spectrum, which are license-specific and small. If DISH does so and appears to be moving to a more robust 5G network, BI analysts doubt the FCC will deny the renewal of the licenses, even though it has legal flexibility to do so and an incentive to act like it will. The FCC may hesitate to cripple what the DOJ views as a critical fourth competitor.

"ECB 1-1 FED . Today was marked by another aggressive broad-based rally in risky assets, following the FOMC yesterday. The Main s31 however, closed little changed (-0.3bp), widening back the c2bp relative to CDX IG s32 it had taken on Tuesday. After the ECB (cf. Tuesday’s Grapple), it was the turn of the Fed to hammer protection cost with accommodative rhetoric. Pricing-wise, the $ OIS market shows one cut fully priced in for July, then one for September and one for December. The UST curve kept bull steepening with the 10y point falling temporarily below 2%. On the € side of the equation, the pricing is little changed with 10bp cut by September. Beyond the Europe-US IG spread, it was noteworthy that firstly the US HY sector outperformed the US IG sector. Indeed, CDX HY re-compressed 3bp vs CDX IG, on a 1:4 basis. And secondly, among sovereign CDS, EM outperformed DM and EM HY outperformed EM IG. This is because of the relative dependence on $ rates of these different segments of the market. And this explains why, among other things, Turkey 5-year CDS can be tighter by 20bp on a day where President Erdogan said 1/ “We would have our own sanctions against them” speaking about the US 2/ “it’s not the end of the world” if Turkey can’t get F-35 fighter jets from the US 3/ while the Fed is moving closer to lowering rates, “the policy rate in my country is 24%, this is unacceptable”.

"A 100bp Question. Nova Chemicals Corp (NCX) produces plastics and other chemical polymers (incl. ethylene, polyethylene, etc) with various industrial applications (incl. packaging, construction, etc). Headquartered in Canada, it serves clients in both Canada and the US. Today its 5y CDS notably tightened by -100bp to 120bp, making it the best performing name in the CDX HY s32 index, almost halving the cost of 5y protection. The 10y range of the 5y has roughly been [40,600] counting after the huge selloff of 2009 on that credit, when Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund Mudabala stepped in to rescue NCX from restructuring due to its large amount of debt. Today’s tightening (talking London closes) came after the JV Chevron-Phillips offered to acquire NCX for >$15 B including debt. NCX isn’t doing super well, so far this year. Indeed, in Q1, NCX had reported (in May) revenues -17% YoY and EBITDA -39% YoY, both missing the Street’s estimates. With liquidity of $2.8B (incl. cash $0.9B), leverage then came up to 1.8x. NCX had been required by a court ruling to make a $1B payment to The Dow Chemical Company (DOW) related to damages in the 2001-2012 timeframe. Mubadala, still the owner of NCX, had been reportedly wanting to attain IG rating on NCX. That was challenging, because of NCX’s decision to increase secured debt to boost liquidity ahead of the pending DOW litigation payments, plus CapEx, plus dividends, etc... So then Mubadala has been exploring a sale since this Q1 (Bloomberg, March). The deal may seem early stage, as, according to the anonymous sources cited by yesterday’s Reuters note, there is no certainty that Mubadala will accept the offer from Chevron-Phillips, another bidder may also emerge, and/or Mubadala may decide to keep a stake in NCX. 
"
"Orient Express. Turkey outperformed the other CDX EM sovereign CDS today, after the opposition party CHP’s candidate Imamoglu gained c55% of the vote in Istanbul, ahead of the President Erdogan-backed AKP candidate Yildirim. This was the re-run of the election where President Erdogan’s opponent had secured a 14k voter gap. This time the gap is much wider (c800k). While the bar is relatively high for early elections (would require MHP to break the alliance with AKP + c50 resignations within the AKP itself), it will be interesting going forward to see whether alternative centre-right political movements can gain traction in Turkey. Part of the reasons for bullish price action today are the fact that AKP didn’t dispute the vote’s results and the sentiment that Erdogan’s influence might be slightly fading. Turkey 5y CDS came tighter by c13bp (after looking tighter by more than 20bp intra-day) on the London close, vs -0.5bp/+21bp for other constituents of the CDX EM. Across other asset classes, the TRY was only slightly up (+0.2%) vs the dollar, but the BIST outperformed the rest of EM (+1.3%). On the economics side of the equation, the next milestones will surely be the May trade balance data this Friday (June 23), the June CPI on July 3, the CBRT meeting on July 25, the inflation report on July 31. Adding to that, on the geopolitical side of things, US President Trump was reportedly weighing some new sanctions on Turkey over buying Russian military systems (S400). According to ICE clearing data available on OTC Streaming, the open interest as of the end of last week was $18.32B, up c$100M from the end of the previous week, while the 5y spread came tighter by c50bp over the period.

"Das Beste Oder Nichts. The auto sector has been little changed in CDS space, so far this week, despite different ongoing stories. On Sunday, Daimler (DAIGR) issued a profit warning (3rd time in 1 year), lowering its outlook for 2019 EBIT, “in the magnitude of the prior year” (meaning EBIT is more likely to grow in [-5%,+5%] than in previous guidance range [+5%,+15%]). This was reportedly due to 1/ higher provisions for various ongoing governmental proceedings 2/ some measures relating to Diesel vehicles. Furthermore, on Saturday it had been announced that DAIGR must recall 60k Mercedes diesel-working models in Germany (GLK produced between 2012 and 2015) after regulators found software aimed at distorting emissions tests. DAIGR said it would appeal against that decision, but on top of that, the ministry said that it was expanding its investigation into other models (incl. the C and E, for a total of 700k+ vehicles potentially). That was not a surprise, as Bild am Sonntag had reported in APR that regulators were looking into the GLK already. Financial implications for this can be big, both in Europe (VW had been fined €1B Audi €0.8B) and in the US (which one could expect to show a much less compromising attitude, given the context). So far this week, the 5y CDS is virtually unchanged (wider by a tiny +2bp) and the stock is down by -4%.

"Priced. Avon Products Inc (AVP) manufactures and sells beauty and related products (fragrances, cosmetics, personal care, fashion and home). This single-B rated name is present in the CDX HY since s24 included, after spending s21 to s23 in IG. Today the 5y CDS of AVP is among the worst-performing names in CDX HY s32, wider by c50bp, thus back to high 320s mid. We are getting back to the levels last seen in May. For reference, on May 22nd, AVP had announced that it had agreed to be acquired by Natura, expected to close in early 2020. Despite anti-trust potential hurdles, the market seems to be expecting a deal, in both stock and CDS. Overnight, AVP announced that Avon International Capital p.l.c. (100%-owned subsidiary) priced an offering of $400M of 6.5 22s (secured) guaranteed by AVP. The deal got upsized from $350M to $400M. That at a yield of mid-6s, so spread in 470s. According to their statement, AVP intends to use the proceeds from the offering of 22s to refinance its existing 20s. For now, AVP has around $2B of debt, all in USD, with around one fifth expiring 2020 (unsecured) and around half expiring 2022 (split between secured and 1L). The short end of the CDS curve steepened a good deal, around 25bp in 1s5s and 2s5s.

"Chicken King. Boparan (BOPRLN), the holding company for 2 Sisters Food Group in particular, was under pressure today again in the credit market, worst performing single-name in the iTraxx Xover s31 with its 5y CDS wider by 4 points this morning. Cash was also consistently off 3-4 points on 2021s, both the € and the £ issues. That latest leg wider/lower (+8% on 5y vs Tue close, at today’s intra-day peak) came after the release of fiscal Q3 numbers yesterday, period that saw the repayment of the 19s. The credit was already under pressure yesterday, and today’s move marks a new wide, we are wider 8 points on the 5y contract, since Tuesday’s € close (from ~40% to 48% mid intra-day then closed 45%). EBTIDA indeed printed at £21.7M, which was more than 20% less than the Q3 of previous fiscal year. But what caused more concern to people as far as liquidity is concerned, was the swing in working capital, rather unexpected, if price action is any guide. Sell-side dealers recommended going short either via CDS or via the 21s (there are £330m 5.50% 21s €300m 4.375% 21s and a £80m revolver maturing 21 as well). Net debt stood at £625m at the end of fiscal Q3, so optically stable/slightly up by +0.4% from the previous year’s FQ3, but sharply up from the £570m as of Q1-19, taking leverage to 8x, up from 7x in the previous quarter. While the company expects that a continued margin improvement in the ‘Poultry’ segment will help FCF/EBITDA improvement eventually leading to de-leveraging, the market almost surely expects a default over the next five years, with implied probability of 94% at that horizon, up from roughly 1/3 priced in, about a year ago. 
"
"Another Brick. The Italian infrastructure group Atlantia SPA (ATLIM) was among European HY underperformers today, with the 5y CDS of this Baa3n/BBB-n rated credit going wider by c8bp, while in contrast, the fair value of the index came tighter by c8bp, against a rather general risk-on backdrop following the positive headlines out of Asia this weekend. This underperformance came after a report commissioned by the Ministry of Transport which concluded that ATLIM’s Autostrade per l'Italia was in “non-fulfilment of custody and maintenance obligations"" and that ""the grounds existed for a termination of the concession for a breach of duty by the concessionaire"".  The report has not been published in an official manner and only extracts have been shown to Reuters, however 5 Star Di Maio posted on Facebook that any compensation for concession revocation would not be “enormous.” For context, it is probably important to keep in mind that the source of the report is a ministry controlled by 5 Star, party which had been criticized for delaying the approval of maintenance work on the bridge. 5 Star seems to be trying to extract the maximum political capital to revive its attractiveness in the polls, at a juncture where the League seems opposed to concession revocation. For reference, 5 Star is now polling in mid 10s, to be compared with the third of votes they got in last general election’s popular vote, in March 2018.According to the Reuters’ piece, ATLIM then accused 5 Star officials of ‘selectively leaking’ information in a campaign to revoke the company’s concession. As far as the official investigation, it will probably be going on until at least 2020, and that will be the key in the assessment of whether ATLIM was at fault, and if so, what are the financial implications for the company.  As far as the defective bridge, its remains got destroyed a few days ago.

"Less Is More. The Italian government lowered its 2019 budget deficit target in order to comply with EU rules and avoid sanctions. The deficit is now expected to be 2.04% of GDP, according to Bloomberg citing an anonymous source. That is to be compared with the draft budget back in April, which was targeting 2.4%. Italian risk rallied on the back of that. In particular, Italian financial CDS outperformed that space. MedioBanca (BACRED) rallied -4.5bp in snr and -7bp in sub. Intesa (ISPIM) rallied -4bp in snr and -7.5bp in sub. UniCredit (UCGIM) rallied -4.5bp in snr and -7.5bp in sub. In sovereign space, the 10y BTP-Bund spread closed a rather sharp c60bp rally since the end of May. 10y yield broke below 1.85% and 2y yield broke below 0. The doc14 5y CDS also capped a c50bp rally since the end of May today. The c€7.6b fall in deficit agreed by ministers for this year, is due to higher revenues and lower spending, including €1.5b previously set aside for social programs in which demand has been lower than expected.
"
"Exuberance Can Burn. CDS in Europe enjoyed another strong session today. The iTraxx Main tightened 1bp, roughly in line with the Senior Financials index, despite the fact that SX7E index outperformed (up +2.5% vs ‘just’ +0.9% for SX5E and SXXP). The continued tightening in intra-EMU spreads (10y BTP/DBR rally is now c90bp tighter since the end of May, we broke the 2% level today) boiled peripheral risk. Thus, BBVASLAC (-4) ISPIM (-6.5) BACRED & UCGIM (-5.5) were the outperformers, against a backdrop of soaring stocks (ISP +5% UCG +5.6%). Data-wise, services and composite PMIs for June printed broadly in line with expectations in the region, services seem to remain the strong link in Western European. As far as the ECB is concerned, the news that Lagarde will replace Draghi this autumn is broadly seen as heralding continuity of what we saw over the past eight years, in terms of reaction function. Whether or not Eurozone leaders have any kind of choice in this matter is another debate. Banque de France’s president Villeroy de Gaulhau has been repeating Draghi's dovish Sintra message today (“there must be no doubt about our determination to act, nor our means to act”, “regarding our means, we are in no way out of ammunition”) before recalling the four tools (short term rates, forward guidance on rates, volume of assets held under APP, liquidity for banks via TLTRO). Against that backdrop, sell-side analysts keep gradually revising their ECB calls, expecting more and more easing in H2. Some had been calling for a -10bp depo rate cut in SEP. Some others are now expecting the ECB to announce an APP restart in DEC, in which it will buy roughly c€40B per month (net purchases, as opposed to just reinvest) for 6 to 9 months. € QE wouldn’t have lasted for long... If that is correct, based on historical CSPP/APP ratios, it can then be fair to assume that roughly c€4B per month would be allocated to corporate bonds (€ senior IG non-financial) net purchases, which would equate to between ½ and 2/3 of the net supply. 
"
"Options. Deutsche Bank AG (DB) CDS has tightened aggressively since the end of May (c150bp on sub & c70bp on slac) along with the broader CDS market (SubFin31 tightened c70bp & SnrFin31 tightened c35bp), with a beta of c2x. That move happened regardless the fact DB will have to restructure but doesn’t have the capital free to do it. CEO’s restructuring plan for S&T; could cost c€5B (FT), to eventually save c€4B (c20k staff was reported). That’s enough to tip it into FY19 loss territory. The option to raise more capital by tapping shareholders is often called off cards, because indeed, DB’s shareholders have already put c€30B into the pot over the past decade, diluting existing ones along the way, and largely participating into the move lower (DB’s share price has lost c85% since the 2010 peak). Another option recently floated to free capital is that DB could cut its CET1% target to 12.5% (from current aim 13% and to be compared with ECB’s minimum of 11.8%). Not super orthodoxic. As of end-2018, CET1 ratio was 14% which is €12B above the ECB’s 2018 SREP letter’s requirement. Not super orthodoxic but can be good to kick the can further down the road. Except that the sacrosanct BCBS has come, under the upcoming brand-new Basel IV framework, with new ways for banks to calculate their capital requirements, in order to make banks more comparable globally. And some analysts expect a potential shock of up to 5% (as in 500bp) to the CET1 ratio new calculation for DB. What’s also not so easy in the ‘cutting non-core/non-profitable’ equation is that some of the businesses where DB targets growth going forward such as take transaction banking and private banking actually rely on non-profitable business such as S&T;’s rates and equities. And an article from Bloomberg today added that the cuts won’t be limited to equities and rates. It won’t be limited to the US either (c9k staff as of end-2018 vs target cut of c20k). In parallel, last month, press reported DB considers creating a new non-core unit, that could contain up to c€50B RWAs (FT). That would be 14% of total RWA. DB had created a non-core unit in 2011 and had closed it 2016. Another reason to doubt this is a good option is that given the current nature of the business, the core bank returns are estimated to be low single digits. Thus, the concerns over DB’s ability to generate organic capital would most likely remain. Without a sustainable fix to the biggest German bank, we might arrive at a juncture where the most likely option available is again to tap shareholders, with another selloff in the stock potentially pressuring credit spreads higher. More color around the cuts are expected soon, and then we will get a broader strategy update, along with the Q2 numbers, on July 24.


NB: the chart was effectively DB SLAC (senior non-preferred) up to May 13 and came DB snr (preferred) from May 14 onwards.

"Tudo Bem. Brazil has been outperforming its EM peers on the day, largely on the back on expectations around the social security reform. The reform has moved forward in the Congress with the approval of the report in the Special Committee by a large majority of 36 votes vs 13 against. For reference, the reform is projected to add cBRL900B (i.e. €210B) into the economy over the next 10 years. The outperformance had effectively happened yesterday in stocks and FX, but CDS was not trading due to July 4. It is noteworthy that this version is a ‘diluted’ compared to the original Bolsonaro’s plan, which was to save around one third more (cBRL1.2T over 10 years). Nevertheless, the package’s size is roughly twice the size of the one that had been proposed by previous President Temer (cBRL450B from his initial cBRL850B). The difference between the two largely comes from the transition period (12 years compared with 20 years in Temer’s package). Timing matters. In addition, the minimum retirement ages of 65/62 went through too. The speaker of the Lower House, Rodrigo Maia, seemingly intends to take the social security reform proposal to the plenary of the Lower House next week. If this happens and they approve the reform before the recess, the CDS may tighten further and the short end may price a higher risk of a selic cut in July BCB meeting (July 31 – same day as FOMC). Brazil CDS thus tightened -2bp, which is nothing spectacular, especially compared to the c150bp we went through since the election period. However, that’s noteworthy that this move tighter was against a backdrop of wider EM spreads in general. Indeed, the CDX EM s31 widened +2bp back around 97%, Turkey 5y CDS is wider +6bp, along with South Africa, also +4.5bp. That broader market move wider was driven by a rates selloff in the US, which spilled over into global risk. We are talking +12bp on the 10y note yield and c20 points of SPX. The move might arguably have been emphasized by the fact that liquidity conditions aren’t optimal, as we are July 5. As far as the data itself, job growth bounced back from a weak 72K in May to a solid 224K in June, clearly above the Bloomberg’s consensus of 160K. Goods-producing industries added 37K jobs (17K mfg 21K construction). Services employment also bounced +154K pushed by business +51K & education/healthcare +61K. Average hourly earnings increased 0.22%MoM in June, below consensus of 0.3%, but the May reading was revised up to 0.32%. Net net, the year-on-year wage growth was unchanged at 3.1%YoY, and the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 3.7% (from 3.6%).

"From First To Last. Deutsche Bank was at focus, following the restructuring news over the weekend. The name opened tighter in CDS (SLAC -8bp SUB -21bp) and stronger in stocks (equity up 4%+ this AM). Nevertheless, the moved was faded throughout the session, with market participants better buyers of protection, taking CDS back to flat and even wider, almost symmetrically to daily tight. In parallel, the stock went from 4%+ up to -5.5% down at the European close. In cash space, the perp lost 2.5c on the day, a tad more than 3c drawdown during the session. As widely expected, updated restructuring plan details were released to the market. The plan looks bigger than expected (complete exit of Equity S&T; and trading businesses seeing RWAs cut c40% / CIR target for 2022 is ambitious: 70% from 93% in 2018), although future ROTE targets in relation to the plan somehow disappointed analysts and market participants (ROTE targets: ‘only’ 8% at the group scale and 6% at the IB by 2022). Concerns over capital remain. As widely expected, DB is not raising equity and plans to lower its minimum CET1 ratio (to 12.5% from 13.0%). The argument is that because DB will bear less risk going forward, it will need less of a capital buffer. There was some decompression between the SLAC and the SUB CDS (on the 5y: +5bp on a 1:1 basis). NB: the displayed contract is DB senior (preferred) 5y.

"Spread*1.3. BASF (BASGR) was among underperformers today, with its 5y CDS spread wider by 6.5bp, not much in absolute but c30% wider compared to the 22bp closing level yesterday. BASGR last night conveyed to the market that it expects Q2-2019 adjusted EBIT to be “considerably below expectations” (c€1B which would imply both a steep decrease compared to last year the same period c-50% YoY and a big miss compared to consensus c50% below). Interestingly, as far as the reasons for the update, BASGR cited significantly weaker-than-expected industrial production and a weak development of the agricultural sector in North America. BASGR has also logically lowered its FY19 adjusted EBIT, which is now expected to be up to 30% below the prior year level. That drove chemical to underperform from this morning. Still in Germany, Bayer (BAYNGR) was downgraded by Fitch by one notch to BBB+ with a Negative outlook. This was on the back of a deterioration in the crop science division, obviously linked to the debate surrounding glyphosate, that putting at risk the company’s de-leveraging trajectory. Fitch guided that this new BBB+ rating now absorbs a single-digit multi-billion disbursement by 2021 and added that a reversion to Stable outlook depends on a resolution of the glyphosate litigation. The move wider later extended to other high-beta sectors such as metals and mining, until a general reversal at the end of the London session. After closing in low 51s yesterday, the Main31 reached 52.5 this morning, before rallying back this PM to sub 51.
"
"‘Outlook Continues To Dim’. Today was marked by another aggressive broad-based rally in risky assets, following Chair Powell’s testimony before Congress. Rates markets seemed positioned for some hawkishness, as G4 govies cheapened, on the basis that since Powell’s previous comments we had had 1/ strong NFP last Friday 2/ Trump/Xi rapprochement 3/ some Fed speakers pushing back on dovishness. Despite those, Powell stressed that inflation has been running below target, that trade tensions/global growth concerns weigh on activity and that uncertainties about the outlook have increased in recent months. That sent global credit spreads down, with CDX IG outperforming iTraxx Main although slightly. The Atlantic spread didn’t move much (now standing at the lows ~4bp) despite the more remarkable outperformance of US yields over core Europe’s. Indeed, the 10y UST/DBR spread tightened by 5bp to c175bp. As far as European financials, greatly dependent on the absolute level of € rates and short end steepness, Powell’s speech came as a halting signal for fin stocks to rally but spurred a rally in credit regardless (c3bp of SnrFin31 and c7bp of SubFin31), after the session had been characterized by a decent decompression in indices (Sub/Snr s31 reached 8bp intra-day while it had closed c5bp yesterday). In EM space also, Powell’s speech dictated the price action, with CDX EM tighter -3bp and the most $/$ rate sensitive sovereign, Argentina, outperformed notably other CDX constituents, tighter -15bp on the 5y. One could have expected Turkey to follow suit in this context, however the fact that President Erdogan explicitly said that the recently dismissed ex CBRT chief should have been quicker to cut rates supported risk premium (the 5y CDS is just tighter -1.5bp on day).
"
"Outlook Unchanged. Suedzucker (SZUGR) CDS underperformed the EUR HY space today, with the 5y spread going wider +4bp while CrossOver fair value is about flat. Intra-day SZUGR was even +7 vs XO FV -3. The European sugar company printed EBIT at €47m, which is down -40% YoY, but still ahead of the consensus number of -€15m. The Sugar division keeps losing traction and weighing at a group level, generating an EBIT of -€36m which is to be compared with +€8m in the same period last year. Other divisions saw their margin increase, measured by EBIT (Special products & CropEnergies) or stagnate (Fruit). As far as cash flow, FCF came €22m after dividends, affected negatively by both lower earnings and higher capital expenditure. Against that backdrop, the group’s net debt was stable, a tad up (+€111m) to a total €1.2b, largely the impact of the IFRS-16 enforcement. Although that looks like a beat for this quarter, the fact that management didn’t change its outlook explains the underperformance today. The stock also opened -4% on Xetra, before paring most of that move. Indeed, the Baa3n/BBB-n rated company confirmed its outlook for this fiscal year, with revenues keeping the range of [€6.7b,€7.0b] and consistently EBIT staying in [0-€100m]. This is despite a stabilization in sugar prices, as indeed EU white sugar prices seem to have found a floor above €300 per metric tonne in the first half of this year. Elsewhere it was a session marked by rates selling off aggressively in the belly of the DM curves (10y Bund +8bp 10y UST +7bp 10y Gilt +8bp), preventing risk to rally much further (SPX back to 2,990 SX5E closed below 3,500).
"
"Three Weeks Later. German auto CDS started the session on the back foot today, with Daimler (DAIGR) CDS underperforming in EUR IG space, wider +5 vs Main31’s fair value -0.4, after the German automaker issued the second profit warning in just three weeks... That timeline (on its own) is worrying. And the downgrade sounds significant, DAIGR now guiding for FY-2019 EBIT “significantly lower” than last year. Strong word. The cut will filter through to cash flow as well, DAIGR now guiding FY-2019 industrial FCF no longer “slightly higher than 2018”. For reference, on June 23, DAIGR had moved EBIT guidance to “flat y/y” vs “slightly up y/y” on the back of higher provisions for various ongoing governmental proceedings and measures relating to diesel vehicles in Mercedes Vans. The structural causes for today’s guidance upward revision & provisions upward revion include: 1/ potential “extended recall in Europe and ROW in connection with Takata airbags”, provisions increased by +c€1B 2/ “ongoing governmental and court proceedings and measures relating to Mercedes-Benz Diesel vehicles”, expected expenses +€1.6B 3/ “earnings of Mercedes Vans in Q2-19” c+€0.5B 4/ “slower product ramp ups affecting product availability throughout 2019” esp. GLE model 5/ “lower growth than expected” in auto markets. The widening stopped, especially after the stronger-than-expected industrial production figures at the Eurozone aggregate level for the month of May (+0.9% MoM vs +0.2% MoM BBG consensus). Going forward, life cycle effects and model changes, which had been a headwind in Q1-19, could revert especially in Mercedes brand’s SUV segment, where the number of units sold went from 212k in Q1-18 to 179k in Q1-19. Daimler Trucks had shown solid numbers, but it is notable that the biggest growth region there was NAFTA (48k units sold in Q1-19 vs 41k in Q1-18), while Europe had stagnated, and Asia had declined... Going forward, however, it doesn’t bode well for DAIGR Trucks, as they had ‘just’ 101k incoming orders as of Q1-19 vs 184k as of Q1-18. This was driven mainly by NAFTA region (decline from 89k to 27k!), largely a reflection of the risk of tariffs on EU industrial products in North America. A risk that FOMC member Evans recalled this afternoon. DAIGR is currently As/A2s/A-s but the outlook for future margins might make rating agencies less generous. The 5y CDS remains in the low end of the post-GFC [30,200] range although the stock is near the lowest in 7y.

"In The Can. Usually when a private equity specialist is circling a company, it is rarely good news for its bondholders. But for once, despite the careful attention the Ontario Pension Fund paid to Ardagh, the bondholders of the latter ended better off at the end of the day. Actually, the fund was only really interested in Ardagh’s Food & Specialty Metal Packaging business. It will eventually merge it with Exal to form Trivium Packaging. The combined entity will operate 57 production facilities, principally across Europe and the United States, with roughly 7,800 employees. Upon completion of the transaction, Ardagh will hold a 43% in Trivium (the other 57% being in the hands of Ontario’s Teachers’) and also receive $2.5Bln. That windfall will be used primarily to pay down debt and bring down leverage. Ardagh’s 5-year risk premium, which had already gone down almost 90bps in June (it was worth 262bps on June 3rd), tightened 13bps to close at 168bps. It is now trading within touching distance of the tights reached 18 months ago. 
"
"We Almost Forgot About It. It had not grabbed any headline for quite a while, but today Brexit came back with a vengeance. The pound slipped almost 1% to 1.24 against the US Dollar. That is the weakest it has been since the end of Q3 2017. It effectively weakened against all major currencies as many investors fear Brexit negotiations could turn more hostile. Ursula von der Leyen, who was later in the day confirmed as the EU Commission President, said she was ready for a further extension of the Brexit deadline “should more time be required for a good reason”, but both contenders to the UK Prime Minister position toughened their rhetoric in a debate yesterday and said the so-called backstop plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland, considered essential by the European Union, would need to be scrapped. Many think it only leaves two options: no-deal Brexit or no Brexit. Caution was obvious in the credit market, and the risk premia of UK names were marked wider across the board. The most affected sector was financials, and, as you can see on the above grapple, there was not a single British bank that ended the session tighter. Their 5-year CDS were indicated 5% wider across the board, from Lloyds’ (+2bps @ 46bps) to Barclays’ and RBS’ (+6bps @ 93bps).  
"
"Going Out With A Bang. Mario Draghi will leave the presidency of the ECB in a few months, and it appears he wants to go on a high. The ECB has apparently begun studying a potential revamp of its inflation goal, as Mr Draghi now favours a “symmetrical approach” which would give the central bank some flexibility to be either above or below its target (currently set at 2%). For instance, it would allow it to keep inflation elevated for a while after a period of weakness to ensure price growth is entrenched. When the report came out mid-morning, it pushed equity markets up and credit risk premia down. After some tentative weakness early on, credit indices gapped tighter. While iTraxx Main never recovered and ended the session within a whisker of its tightest level of the year, iTraxx Crossover rapidly found people interesting in buying protection. A number of its constituents have been trading poorly recently (Loxam, Casino, Thomas Cook, Boparan, Pizza Express were all wider on the day again) and the fact that the question of the default of Galapagos (a member of iTraxx Crossovere series 22 to 30 but not the current series 31) was officially asked to the ISDA Determination Committee yesterday probably did not help either. This set the scene for one of the biggest sessions of decompression we have experienced in a while. That phenomenon is often measured by comparing the risk premium of iTraxx Crossover to 4x the risk premium of iTraxx Main: it widened by 7bps on the day, and while it was trading at 25bps not long ago, it closed at 54bps tonight.
"
"And Another. GALAPG (Galapagos Holding S.A.) was a member of iTraxx Crossover series 22 to series 30. Owned by funds managed by Triton, a private equity group, it is the holding company for the operating companies of Galapagos SA, which is a global manufacturer of heat exchangers for industrial applications in sectors ranging from oil and gas to food and beverages. On June 15th, GALAPG did not make an interest payment due under some of its notes and failed to cure this situation during the contractual 30 days grace period. The situation was swiftly brought to the ISDA Decision Committee’s attention on July 17th and last Friday the DC issued a statement confirming that a Failure to Pay credit event took place. It did not come as a big surprise to any investor as the 1-year default probability of GALAPG implied by the price of CDS has been above 70% for the past 3 months and above 90% since their missed payment. It is the third default in quick succession of companies that were included in some series of the iTraxx Crossover – after Newlook and Rallye – and that certainly shows that cheap money is not necessarily enough to maintain any highly leveraged entity as a going concern.
"
"No Room For Disappointment. The deal struck between the White House and Democratic party leaders to raise the US debt ceiling, a self-imposed arbitrary limit on the amount of sovereign debt the US can issue and a regular feature of Republican Party opposition to Barack Obama was the main news today. It was reportedly crafted by Democrat House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin, and confirms the funding of the Government through to 2021, and well past the next 2020 election. But it was certainly not the reason for the further leg tighter took by credit risk premia across the board today. This leg tighter is down to the now extremely high expectations that investors have going into the ECB meeting on Thursday. Even though nothing material should be announced (no rate cut for now, no new purchase programme nor any change in the pricing of TLTRO for the moment), most hope that it will pave the way for those tools and they have been bracing themselves for such an outcome recently. Credit Financial indices (Senior and Subordinated) have massively outperformed all the others. They are both 5bps tighter over the last 5 sessions, and 12bps and 15bps tighter respectively over the last month. There is no room for disappointment in 48 hours.
"
"That Was Not The Script . Today’s session was all about the ECB meeting and the following press conference held by Mr Draghi. The central bank did not break ground and confirmed what had been anticipated by the market: interest-rate cuts (with tiering to help banks), new forward guidance and QE. But all that will have to wait until September. The credit market, which had started the day on a weak note, welcome the news and risk premia were indicated sharply tighter. But during his press conference, Mr Draghi failed to offer more details. In fact the Governing Council did not discuss issue or issuer limits, a key element to any new asset purchase program, and it also appeared that its members are not all fully on board with all the parts of the proposed package. It could make for a tough meeting in September. So much so that a reversal materialised during the press conference, which pushed credit indices meaningfully off their tightest levels, and even wider on the day. 


"
"Boris Means Boris. UK spreads underperformed the broader European credit market, with the ‘local’ UK financials CDS leading the move wider. Indeed BACRPLC, LLOYDSGR and RBSGRP are the worst-performing names in the iTraxx Main, all wider +8bp today in senior 5y. Those names compressed up to 3bp at the close, in sub/snr terms on a 1:2 basis, after steeper compression intra-day. This move comes at a juncture where market participants re-price the Brexit risk premium. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Cabinet members have only re-asserted over the past few days their willingness to prepare for a no-deal outcome, although the new PM still argues that there will be a deal. Something which is 100% consistent with the platform on which Boris gained the leadership of the Conservative Party early last week, and which, again, looks like a ""we will jump out of a window"" stance. UK non-financial IG names (incl. ROLLS, ITVLN) also underperformed, to a lesser extent. In CDS indices space, this UK vs € relative underperformance translated into a slight underperformance of SnrFin by +2/3bp against Main (1:1) and SubFin (1:2). Other asset classes also reflected this higher Brexit risk premium. GBP lost -1.3% vs USD, -1.5% vs EUR & CHF. The £ short end rallied a tad, still pricing in a -25bp cut for the end of Q1-2020. Further down the curve, in sovereigns, the 5y Gilt outperformed the Bobl by c3bp. The £ 5y5y inflation swaps underperformed its €/$ equivalents by c4bp, on fears that a sustained selloff in GBP could revive inflation expectations in a ‘relatively open’ economy such as the UK. More generally, it is worth noting that credit synthetics have underperformed stocks globally, and especially in the UK where a lower GBP boiled the local equity market. As media talks about an early election in the UK have intensified, it is worth noting that the Conservatives have rebounded in the polls over the past few weeks, mainly at the expense of Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, which implies, once again, pressure on the Conservative government to deliver Brexit. 
"
"Another Warning. Schaeffler (SHAEFF) pre-released some of its to-come Q2 numbers along with a profit warning overnight. In Q2-19, sales -2% YoY EBIT -29.7% YoY FCF came €6m (vs. -€5m in Q2-18). FY19 guidance was adjusted, with sales growth guided to [-1%,+1%] from [+1%,+3%] previously. EBIT margin was guided [7%,8%]  from [8%,9%] previously. FCF was guided [€350m,€400m] from c€400m previously. In the light of July 12 Grapple, this profit warning is not surprising. Indeed, there has been several guidance revisions from other firms of this sector, including most importantly Daimler (DAIGR). Nevertheless, consensus still looks like it may need to come down marginally as a result. Q2 itself looks in line to slightly better than feared although Auto margins disappointed (sequentially deteriorating), offset elsewhere. Other black swans for this industry include US tariffs and and a no-deal Brexit. Today SHAEFF 5y CDS is wider +4bp. Beyond that, it is worth noting that British carmakers miners & industrials joined financial companies in the move wider, with in particular Glencore (GLENLN) wider +17 Rolls Royce (ROLLS) wider +8 and Jaguar Land Rover (TTMTIN) wider +12.
"
"On the Wings of the Doves?. Most CDS kept range-bound today, ahead of the FOMC decision and Chair Powell’s press conference. Long-term US rates are also consistently stuck in [202.5,205]. Trump’s headlines yesterday stating that he wants to see a large cut (as in more than 25bp) and a balance sheet runoff stop (QT stop) were nothing new, so it didn’t get much echo in our market. Two weeks ago, a surprisingly dovish-sounding NY Fed President Williams had made some bet on 50bp cut, but the evidence that since last FOMC domestic data have been solid and the fact that some members are still against a rate cut altogether make a 50bp cut look less likely, although not impossible. $ OIS pricing has thus fluctuated below 25bp and 30bp for this meeting, asserting that a double-cut is more likely than no cut at all. Beyond the question of the rate cut ‘size’, the prospects for an early balance sheet runoff stop and the guidance on whether this is not a one-off will be key. In the less likely event of the latter, we would see the market widen, following a decent bear flattening in the $ front end. That would mean back to full data-dependency mode. But the most likely guidance will be for other cuts, starting with one at September meeting, consistently with market pricing. That would reassert the next steps for the Fed to ‘compete’ with ECB (and BoJ) as far as easing is concerned. The CIS market also seemingly anticipates that scenario, as the CDX IG has gained back some ground over the iTraxx Main. The CDX is now back to less than 2bp cheap to Main versus 4bp earlier this week. The DTCC data relating non-dealer positioning as of last week shows that clients, over the week, have increased their long risk exposure via CDX IG (by c$3b) while they have notably reduced their long risk exposure through iTraxx Main (by c$7b). Anecdotally, as far as the data released today, while the ADP survey came broadly in line with expectation (156k vs 150k BBG consensus), the ECI missed (0.6% vs 0.7% BBG consensus) and the MNI Chicago PMI missed by a landslide (44 vs 51 BBG consensus), confirming rumors that it would print sub 50 this AM.

"Family Business. The family behind Nordstrom Inc. (JWN) was reportedly (WSJ) seeking to increase its stake in the department-store chain to >50%. Historically, the 3 brothers co-managed JWN, acting like one CEO. The oldest of the 3 brothers and ex co-president, Blake Nordstrom, had died unexpectedly in January. This development came yesterday night and happens at a juncture where JWN stocks have lost more than ½ of their value since last Q4 and 1/3 YTD so it looks like a good entry point on the chart, for the two remaining brothers and co-presidents. The stocks soared on that news, as buying back shares at a premium looks like a plausible option. However, than was bad for credit. Spreads widened c30bp on the 5y CDS and the 3s5s steepened by more than half of that. Interestingly, such a family-led buyout was at $50/share in 2018, before some directors blocked it arguing the price was too low. At the time the stock was north $50 by a tad. Now it is low 30s… The US macro picture was also on the weak side yesterday after the Fed’s ‘hawkish cut’ but risk reverted today.  Data-wise, in the US, today the ISM manufacturing index declined wile expectations were for a small increase. While new orders component increased, both the production and employment components pulled back. Construction spending also decreased (for June), although its growth in prior months got revised upwards. That let risk go stronger (SPX gained more than 1% after the data) and rates went richer (10y note now yielding 195bp). Although it can be volatile, the Atlanta Fed GDPnow index rose to 2.2% from 2%. Tomorrow the main data to watch will be the employment report. 
"
"Transported Wider…. Bombardier (BOMB) reverted wider on the back of disappointing results for Q2. The 5y CDS has widened c100bp over the past two sessions, the big chunk of the move having happened yesterday. This was after BOMB’s profit and margin dropped more than anticipated. The company is divided between Aviation (incl. Commercial Aircrafts, Business Aircrafts & Aerostructures) and Transportation (which manufactures train-like vehicles such as metro, tram, light rail, commuter, monorail). This drop (& miss) in profit occurred in almost all sub-units (exception: Commercial Aircrafts). In particular, the Transportation unit’s margins and cash flow fell due to additional costs coming from legacy projects (BT Action Plan) involving trains in UK/Germany/Switzerland. That cost a c$275m (mid-point of the $250-300m range) more than previously planned through 2019. BOMB also revised its guidance down. Indeed, BOMB now expects sales between $16.5b and $17b, from >=$17b. They still guide a revenue of c$8.75b for the Transportation unit but they cut the guidance in the aviation arm. That legacy project is the main driver behind the downward revision to cash flow guidance (from breakeven +/- $250m to c-$500m). Business Aircrafts & Aerostructure (BA&A;) top line came up thanks to more deliveries, but margin-wise, this unit is under pressure. Globally at the group level, revenue printed around flat vs Q2-18, in Q2-19, at $4.3b. Stable. But, due to BA&A; mainly, adjusted EBIT as per company presentation fell -24% and are now consistent with sub-5% margins. This trend may let one suppose that legacy train projects can continue to drag EBIT margin and FCF further into 2020. EBIT are guided down -30%, while FCF is expected -$500m. The business looks broadly unbalanced, between the rail business, which drives cash flow and the jet business, which is more of a drag. 
"
"Less Volume, Less Margin. Whiting Petroleum Corporation (WLL) saw its 5y spread virtually double, i.e. widen by c290bp since July 31 (European) close. This came after a very poor Q2 set of results and a revised guidance. They printed an adjusted loss per share of -28c vs an expectation of +62c EPS, although the range of expectation tracked by Bloomberg was rather wide (starting at +12c). But none of the predictors expected a loss. Realized price per unit of both oil and gas were down in a double-digit fashion, compared to Q2-18. The stock has lost c43% since July 31 (European) close. In Q2 production was affected by issues related to infrastructure constraints, which are expected to remain until the end of the year. Not only the output but the price at which the company sold gas has also been affected by these, on top of a systemic oversupply environment. WLL therefore had to also reduce its full-year output guidance. Which makes market participants wary that it is not going to generate much cash flow before next year. Last month, WLL agreed to sell some properties for $53m, that may weigh and also reduce full-year output. Against this challenging backdrop, another alarming sign for markets is that WLL is implementing an organizational restructuring that will reduce its workforce by c33% (i.e. 254 staff incl. 94 executives) to save $50m on an annual basis, after this plan will have incurred a (one-off) $8m charge. On top of WLL total output being less than expected, its oil production more specifically also declined in the mix. It seems that WLL’s oil percentage will be around 65-65.5% for the year, due to delays in new wells which happen to have higher oil %.
